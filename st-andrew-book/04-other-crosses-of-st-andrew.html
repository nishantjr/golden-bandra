      <p>A carved stone cross of unknown origin, sculpted in 1720, stands on a
pedestal at the northern extremity of the graveyard, opposite the
start</p>
<p>of St Paul Road, where there was a side-gate in the compound wall.
This gate was removed in 1983, and the space has been walled up.</p>
<p>Some parishioners will remember that this cross originally stood in
front of our church where today the statue of Christ the King
stands.</p>
<p>It is said that when the cross was removed in 1934, to make place for
the statue, it was left discarded lying in the church compound. The then
Vicar,</p>
<p>Msgr Dominic DeSa who was responsible for its removal, became rather
ill; this was the signal reminder for him to have the cross set up on a
pedestal where it stands today; he did this and his illness left
him.</p>

<p>Yet another stone cross stands on a pedestal in the temporary
graveyard opposite the Virendra housing colony in the south side of the
church compound.</p>
<p>This cross was sculpted to commemorate the completion of the third
chapel on the Mount in 1761. The cross was originally planted on a
pedestal beside the road in front of Mount Mary Chapel. Years later this
cross was removed and brought to St Andrew\â€™s to be set up in its
present position.</p>
<p>The date 1761 is carved at the base of the cross.</p>
