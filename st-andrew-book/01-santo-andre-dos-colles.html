<p>Twice every year, as winter gives way to the swelter of summer, and
again when the monsoon damp begins to dry out, the regulars at morning
Mass at the Church of St Andrew are privileged to witness a gradual,
wondrous traverse. As the sun rises in the sky far beyond the Bandra
Railway Station, its rays flood through the skylight above the choir
loft of the Church of St Andrew and fall like a spotlight on the main
arch between the gilded side altars.</p>
<p>Each week, as if manipulated by a divine stagehand, the luminous
circle glides steadily across the span. Finally, on the morning of the
equinox, on March 21 and September 22, at 7 o’clock, the spotlight locks
in on the main attraction: the simple white-washed cross that forms the
centerpiece of the arch.</p>
<p>This manmade miracle has been a bi-annual event for four centuries,
surviving plagues, cyclones, a structural extension and the eruption of
towering buildings all around. It serves as a reminder to the faithful
that the ancient structure in which they worship is the embodiment of
both human wisdom and heavenly design.</p>

<p>To appreciate just how long the Church of St Andrew has dominated the
Bandra shoreline, it is worth recalling that it is about 50 years older
than the Taj Mahal in Agra. A recently installed plaque on the front
wall of the structure says, perhaps too boldly, that it was built in
1575. Though the Church of St Andrew is Bandra’s oldest standing church,
it was not its first. That honor went to the Church of St Anne, a
sanctuary and strategic fortification, built around 1575. The Church of
St Andrew as it stands today was probably built around 1595, perhaps
replacing a more rudimentary structure that had been in turn chapel and
hermitage.</p>
<p>In 1739, the British rulers of Bombay, with the assent of the
Portuguese Captain-General, destroyed St Anne’s and its fortifications
to prevent it serving as a base for the Maratha forces that then
occupied Salsette Island.</p>
<p>For the next 114 years, the Church of St Andrew served as Bandra’s
mother church, until a series of quarrels over jurisdiction and the
desire for autonomy led to the formation of other parishes: St Peter’s
in 1853, and Mount Carmel’s (which splintered away from St Peter’s) in
1891.</p>
<p>In the four centuries since its construction, the Church of St Andrew
has witnessed the evolution of Bandra from a pastoral settlement of
farmers and fishermen into Bombay’s most desirable neighborhood. It has
become the preferred address of some of India’s most affluent people and
most glitzy commercial establishments, with motor access to the island
secured by both a causeway and a snaky sealink across the bay.</p>
<p>The changes would surely have stunned the man who was the most
assiduous chronicler of Bandra’s development during the first 300 years
of St Andrew’s existence. Braz Fernandes, whose grave lies just outside
the shrine’s southern wall, could barely contain his enthusiasm for his
hometown when he wrote Bandra: Its Religious and Secular History in
1927. In his introduction, he waxed eloquent about Bandra’s beautiful
location on the tidal creek, offering “one of the finest panoramas on
this coast”; Bandra Hill, “dotted with palatial buildings and crowned
with the chapel of Our Lady of the Mount”; the Bandra Fort, built in
1640; and the “wide stretch from Land’s End to Bandra [that] form a
graceful vista against the background of the great chain of the Western
Ghauts”.</p>
<p>The establishment of regular train services in 1867 had much to do
with propelling Bandra’s growth. “The people of the crowded city of
Bombay were driven to seek more light, purer air, and greater freedom”
in Bandra, he wrote.</p>
<p>But Bandra wasn’t home to only the affluent. Fernandes also took note
of the town’s more humble folk, who lived in “huts and hovels; houses
huddled together; [on] narrow streets [with] resorts of cattle, sheep
and pigs”. He also mentions another animal, as he speculates about the
possible origins of the town’s name. “A.story is that the inhabitants of
the place were so ugly in appearance that the Mohammedan [rulers of
Bombay] called them bundars, monkeys”. (More prosaically, it’s quite
likely that Bandra took its name from the bunder, or jetty, that
probably stood somewhere near the site of the present Jain temple.)</p>
<p>Despite his obvious pride in Bandra, by the end of his 133-page book,
Fernandes was already wary of the changes. “Today Nature has yielded to
the hand of man; on those verdure-clad slopes, the palm-fringed shores
and the wide rice-fields have risen palaces and mansions, and yet Bandra
seems to have outgrown”. He complained (90 years ago), “The house famine
is acute”.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly the Church of St Andrew gets an entire chapter in
his book, since it was, after all, “the oldest building now standing in
Bandra”. But of course, Fernandes was by no stretch the first person to
write about the church.</p>

<p>Among the earliest mentions of the structure is in the Account of the
Parish of St Andrew, situated in the same village of Bandra, which
appeared in the annual Jesuit Letter to the Order’s headquarters in Rome
in 1669, about seven decades after the church had been built.</p>
<p>“On the edge of this village of Bandra, next to the maritime beach,
is the church known as St Andrew of the Kolis” or Santo Andre dos
Colles, as it is referred to in the Portuguese letter. The church was
built with materials that were among the finest in the region, the
letter said, and though the poverty of the parishioners did not allow
extravagant ornamentation, it was by no means unimpressive.</p>
<p>“The main altar is majestic and speckled” with paint imitating marble
“with its retable parts in gold, the twelve Apostles serving as its
columns and St Andrew having the prominent place,” the letter said. “It
has two collateral altars: in one is a Holy Crucifix of much note; and
in the other is Our Lady, known as ‘of the Navigators’.” It added,
“Towards the expenses of its altars, the Kolis spend liberally within
the confines of their poverty.”</p>
<p>Over the centuries, the church has undergone several changes: it has
been repaired and enlarged and strengthened and the majestic main altar,
which fell prey to termites, has been replaced in the last century by an
equally impressive one.</p>
<p>Through the years, the shrine has provided refuge for its
parishioners that has been both spiritual and physical. In the year
1931, for instance, when a cyclone threatened, one old-time parishioner
recalled that the worshippers flocked to the church, where their vicar,
Fr Dominic de Sa “in flickering candlelight led them in reciting the
rosary and other prayers while, with lightning and thunder, the storm
raged outside, until, miraculously, the storm abated”.</p>
<p>But more than the stoutness of its walls, the Church of St Andrew has
endured because of the devotion of its parishioners. That was evident
from the early days of the formation of the parish, when the Jesuit
letter made it a point to note the piety of the younger members of the
church. “They have as a habit, and obligation, to gather every afternoon
in this church to sing the Christian Doctrine, wherein the translator
always assists, and then the Hail Mary near the door of this church, and
those who live further away [sing] at the same time near the [votive]
Cross that they have in their Koliwada, and today one finds many of
these [young ones] with seven or eight years of age who have memorized
three or four chapters,” it said.</p>
<p>It’s a sentiment that the vicar, Msgr George Fernandes reiterated in
1966. He noted that the Church of St Andrew was not “bricks and mortar
alone” but existed “in the hearts and homes of all the good people of
the parish by their shining example, fervent prayers, wonderful
cooperation and generous self-sacrifice.”</p>
<p>With grace and devotion, many more equinoxes will follow.</p>
