      <p>For over 400 years, the structure of the Church of St Andrew has
stood tall and graceful over its surroundings a landmark visible for
miles in all directions. Fishermen from Bandra’s five colourias while
far out at sea would use it as a beckoning signpost of home.</p>

<p>The sturdy walls, over five feet thick, support a steep roof of teak
timbers, which would have been thatched at one time. There are reports
of many cyclones and storms that did damage to the roof, which is not
surprising for a roof perched high on an exposed seashore. From Jesuit
and other accounts we do know that a cyclone on the May 16th 1618,
caused extensive damage to many churches along the entire west coast,
destroying the roof of the Church of St Andrew.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“…the church of the Jesuits (was) unroofed and gaped in clefts almost
past repair. Nothing was more hideous than the destruction of the palm
groves, thousands of palms were torn out by the roots, and some the wind
lifted through the air like feathers and carried distances. The whole
was like the ruin at the end of all things.”</p>

<p>The reconstructed roof was burnt when the Marathas invaded Bandora
during the Maratha-Portuguese war of 1737-39. In the course of the
invasion the church also lost its orginal bells, which were later
replaced. The roof needed further work in 1764, 1823, 1864 and 1931.
Parishioners recall two other cyclones that caused damage to the
structure of the church. A major storm on October 16th 1940, and another
equally violent storm on November 22nd 1948, when some portions of the
roof lost their tiles and supporting members.</p>
<h3>The Facade</h3>
<p>The front facade of the church is ornamented simply. The cross atop
the church was a conventional one in the early nineteenth century, but
at some point was replaced with a life-size statue of Saint Andrew with
the X-shaped cross in front. The storm of October 16th 1940, dislodged
the statue and cross, which fell to the ground in pieces. After this,
the church was graced once again with a conventional cross made of stone
bracketed by two stone curlicues. A statue of the saint was placed in a
niche on the front facade. When the church was extended and the new
facade built, it was topped with a cross of masonry. The old stone cross
and curlicues are today situated on the south side of the church
compound.</p>
<p>In 1890 a wooden porch was built as an extension to the church to
accommodate the increasing number of parishioners. This porch was
removed in 1966 when the church was extended.</p>
<h3>Planning of the Church</h3>
<p>The planning of the church resembles the planning of other colonial
Portuguese churches in Goa and Bombay. Unlike Roman churches which had a
cruciform plan, Portuguese churches have largely been rectangular in
plan with an axial arrangement of the various parts. The Church of St
Andrew is designed symmetrically about an east-west axis, with the
sanctuary at the west end.</p>
<p>The church is divided into the sanctuary, which houses the main altar
from where the priest celebrates Mass and other services. The nave, the
body of the church, is where the faithful are seated. In between the
sanctuary and the nave is the narrow chancel with the two side
altars.</p>
<h3>The Sanctuary</h3>
<p>The sanctuary houses the main altar, as well as the altar table. The
sacristy, where the sacred vessels and vestments are kept, is located on
the north side of the sanctuary and can be directly accessed through it.
It is in the sacristy that the priests robe themselves, before entering
the church for Mass and other services. According to legend, the
sanctuary also houses the grave of Fr Manuel Gomes SJ, the “Apostle of
Salsette” who died in 1590 and is credited with almost single handedly
converting Bandra to Christianity.</p>
<h3>The Chancel</h3>
<div class="aside">
<figure>
<img src="./Communio.jpg" alt="Melville Mendes. c 1990s" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Melville Mendes. c 1990s</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The chancel is the area between the nave and the sanctuary, where the
two original wooden side altars as well as the present marble baptismal
font are located. The chancel is accessed directly from the nave or
through two doors, one each on its northern and southern faces. The
chancel leads to the sanctuary through an arched opening. In the early
church, and up to 1966, there were four long wooden benches in the
chancel for use by the faithful. Also, up to 1966 there was a wooden
communion rail separating the nave from the chancel. The faithful would
kneel at this rail to receive communion at Mass.</p>
<h3>The Nave</h3>
<p>The nave includes the original nave as well as the fifty foot
extension which is slightly broader and which was added in 1966. Both
these areas combined now seat approximately five hundred. The nave is
accessed by three doors on the northern, three on the eastern and three
on the southern wall. In 1935, the windows in the side walls were
lowered to aid ventilation. The ceiling of the church is of teak boards.
It was constructed in 1862 and at that time was hung with chandeliers.
The choir loft is situated on an upper level at the eastern extremity of
the nave. This is now being used as a temporary museum area to house
church artifacts.</p>
<h2 class="fullwidth">The Sanctuary and the Main Altar</h2>
<div class="fullwidth">
<p>The main altar was constructed in 1906 after the previous one had
been destroyed by termites. The present one, which is made of wood and
built on a brick base paved with marble, extends almost to the roof.</p>
</div>
<p>The life-size statue of St Andrew dominates the main altar. The Saint
holds an X-shaped cross. Legend has it that when he was to be crucified,
St Andrew asked that he not be hung upon a conventional cross, as he
felt he was unworthy of dying on the same cross as his Master had been.
Therefore an X-shaped cross was fashioned which has since been
associated with St Andrew.</p>
<p>St Andrew is flanked by a statue of the Sacred Heart of Jesus on his
right. On his left is a delicately fashioned statue of Our Lady that
bears a small plaque on its base: “St Ulrich In Groden, Kirol,
Austria”</p>
<p>The carved wooden panel on the main altar facade, the Agnus Dei, was
fashioned from the original teak communion rails when these were removed
in the 1990s.</p>
<div class="fullwidth">
<p><img src="./LRL12201.jpg" style="width:32.0%" alt="Roy Gonsalves. 2015" /> <img src="./LRL12200.jpg" style="width:32.0%" alt="Roy Gonsalves. 2015" /> <img src="./LRL12202.jpg" style="width:32.0%" alt="Roy Gonsalves. 2015" /></p>
</div>
<p>At the very top of the altar is a statue of Bom Jesu flanked on one
side by a statue of John the Baptist, with his distinctive animal skin
robe and on the other, St Sebastian. The devotion to St Sebastian is
particularly significant for the people of Bandra. The town, along with
other regions of Salsette and Bombay Island, was afflicted by multiple
outbreaks of the plague in the nineteenth century. St Sebastian is the
saint who protects from “plague and pestilence”.</p>
<div class="fullwidth">
<p><img src="./LRL12203.jpg" style="width:32.0%" alt="Roy Gonsalves. 2015" /> <img src="./LRL12204.jpg" style="width:32.0%" alt="Roy Gonsalves. 2015" /> <img src="./LRL12205.jpg" style="width:32.0%" alt="Roy Gonsalves. 2015" /></p>
</div>
<p>The altar reaches up almost to the sanctuary ceiling. It stands about
three feet away from the back wall. Interestingly, there is a large
niche on this back wall that hints at its use as the altar wall, perhaps
in the earliest days, with the life-size statue of Saint Andrew placed
in it.</p>
<p>Note the two circular windows on the back wall with the X-shaped
cross of St Andrew. These are accessible through a gallery behind. The
door on the north side to the sacristy was built in 1935 for easier
access. The window on the south wall was built in 1964 for better
ventilation.</p>
<p>Traditionally churches were constructed along an east-west axis. The
altar was placed in the west, so that the priest and congregation faced
the Holy Land. However some churches have their altar placed in the
east. The explanation for this is that the priest and congregation face
the rising sun, which is a symbol of the resurrection of Christ.</p>
<p>The altar in the Church of St Andrew is placed in the west. An
unsubstantiated source states the church entrance was originally in the
west, so that the altar would have been in the east. However there is no
evidence to believe this. A sketch of the church by a Scottish
missionary, Mitchell, around 1831, (page 12) shows the church building
aligned as it is today with the altar placed at the west end.</p>
<p>After Vatican II churches began changing to an altar where the priest
would face the faithful. In the Church of St Andrew this was done in the
1990s.</p>
<p>On the dome of the Sanctuary was a fresco depicting God the Father.
There is an amusing description of this from the 1960s: “A regular hole
in the general region of God the Father’s stomach appeared to be the
dwelling place of a family of sparrows. Eyes reverently cast heavenwards
would be treated to the vision of the Creator accommodatingly receiving
unto Himself one of His more cheeky creations equipped with straw that
was going to make his dwelling place more habitable…” Unfortunately this
fresco was later painted over.</p>
<p>The ‘Juliet balcony’ in the Sanctuary, (below) was from where
indisposed priests could attend Mass out of view of the rest of the
faithful in the church.</p>

<h2 class="fullwidth">South side altar</h2>
<h3 class="fullwidth">Holy Crucifix upon a Golgotha Base</h3>
<div class="fullwidth">
<p>The Jesuit Letter describes the side altars thus: “the other altar,
the scene on Mount Calvary is depicted with statues of Our Lady and
St. John at the foot of the Cross upon which Christ hangs. In the crypt
of this altar lies an ancient and treasured statue of the dead Christ,
which is used during the Lenten services. Both these altars are the
original ones; they are made of wood dexterously carved and
painted.”</p>
<p>This statue is venerated by thousands from different parishes in
Bandra on the night after the Good Friday service.</p>
<p><img src="./LRSideAL.jpg" style="width:49.0%" /> <img src="./LRSideA0.jpg" style="width:49.0%" /></p>
</div>
<p>Until fairly recently each side altar had its own tabernacle. The
main altar was for the scheduled Masses. A visiting priest wanting to
say a private Mass used a side altar.</p>
<div class="aside">
<figure>
<img src="./LRGolgot.jpg" alt=" " />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true"> </figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Notice the “Golgotha base” on which the crucifix is planted. The
skull and crossbones are symbols of death. Showing them under Jesus’
feet symbolises Christ conquering Death by His death. Among the Jews it
was traditionally represented that the skull of Adam, after being handed
by Noah to his son Shem, and by him to Melchisedech, was finally
deposited at Golgotha, which in Aramaic means ‘the place of the skull’.
It was probably a small hill just outside the walls of ancient
Jerusalem. Curiously the Golgotha base here depicts not one but two
skulls.</p>
<h2 class="fullwidth">North side altar</h2>
<h3 class="fullwidth">Our Lady of the Navigators</h3>
<div class="fullwidth">
<p>The side altars are the original 16th century creations in wood. They
are carved and painted in the style of that period known as
“Flamboyant”. This architectural style has its own parameters and
certainly the abundance of carving, floral detail and gold leaf justify
the name.</p>
</div>
<p>The Jesuit Letter of the year 1669 describes the side altars thus: “…
on the other is Our Lady, known as ‘of the Navigators’, and the origin
of this title is mysterious, because once upon a time, the kolis were
fishing in this sea of Bandora, and they cast a much better net than
that cast by St. Peter in [the lake] Tiberias [or the Sea of Galilee].
There, St. Peter fished a fish, here the kolis fished not a fish but a
statue of the true Mother of Pearl, within which the pearl JESUS was
found and with festive joy placed it [the statue] in this church, on the
altar…”</p>
<p>According to one local tradition this statue is venerated by some as
Our Lady of the Mount. Sometime around 1700 the statue of Our Lady of
the Mount in the chapel on the hill was damaged. The statue of Our Lady
of Navigators in the Church of St Andrew was then taken in procession to
the Mount and placed there on the vacant altar where it remained till
1760. The devotees grew accustomed to venerating this statue as Our Lady
of the Mount and continued to do so even after 1760 when the statue was
restored to its original place at the Church of St Andrew.</p>
<h3>The Pulpit</h3>
<div class="aside">
<p><img src="./PULPITCa.jpg" data-credit="NB 2015" /></p>
<p><img src="./HermanPU.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<p>Resembling a huge flower poised on the stalk which seems to grow out
of the massive wall and curving upwards, the pulpit is the original one
of the church. The seven sepals turn outward, neatly held together by
angels and on each petal we see a carving representing figures of the
Old and New Testament.</p>
<p>Above the pulpit is mounted a canopy with the Holy Ghost in the form
of a dove carved on it. Besides its obvious ornamentation, the canopy
also served a very practical purpose in the days before microphones were
available. It helped amplify the voice of the preacher so that he was
heard in every corner of the church.</p>
<p>Originally, entry to the pulpit was by stone steps from the exterior
of the church. These were demolished in 1963 and, with two sepal panels
removed, a wooden stairway was erected inside the church. These two
panels sadly have since disappeared and in 1999 seemed to have surfaced
in Australia. Attempts to recover them have not yet succeeded.</p>

<p>The panel may protray the prophet <strong>Jeremiah</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jer.27:2: “This is what the Lord said to me: Make a yoke out of
straps and crossbars and put it on your neck.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A small bundle and what seems to be a vessel at his feet. Jeremiah
48:18: “Now, mortal man, pack a bundle just as a refugee would and start
out before nightfall.”</p>

<div class="aside">
<p><img src="./LRPanelG.jpg" /></p>
</div>
<p>This panel may depict <strong>Isaiah;</strong> an angel holds a
burning coal to his lips.</p>
<p>(Isaiah 6:7) “Then one of the seraphim flew to me with a burning coal
in his hand, which he had taken from the altar with tongs. He touched my
mouth with it and said, Behold, this has touched your lips; and your
iniquity is taken away and your sin is forgiven.”</p>
<p>The letters GENEIS appear at the base.</p>

<p><strong>St Peter</strong> portrayed with two keys.</p>
<p>(Matthew 16:16), Jesus said, “I will give you the keys to the Kingdom
of Heaven. Whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in Heaven; and
whatever you loose on Earth shall be loosed in Heaven”. Often, one key
is gold, representing the power to bind and loose in Heaven -spiritual
authority; the other silver, represents the power to bind and loose on
Earth - temporal authority. At his feet, the papal tiara, signifying
papal authority which began with Peter, the first pope.</p>

<p>The lion, a figure of courage and monarchy, is a symbol of St Mark.
Legend has it that he was thrown to the lions and the animals refused to
attack or eat him.</p>

<p>The panel with <strong>St Paul</strong> holding a sword. He was
beheaded with a sword, as that was the only death considered worthy for
a Roman citizen.</p>
<p>The book he holds represents St Paul’s writings to the new Christian
communities in his epistles.</p>
<p>S.PLLo for São Paulo</p>
<h2 class="fullwidth">North Bas Relief: Coronation of Mary</h2>
<p>Two ancient wood panels with exquisite carvings hang above the side
doors in the middle of the nave possibly coming from the Santa Anna
church.</p>
<p>The bas relief on the north wall depicts the assumption of Our Lady
into Heaven to receive the crown held over her head by the hands of God
the Father and God the Son, while the Holy Ghost hovers above. The
Blessed Trinity is ready to receive the Handmaid of the Lord and crown
her Queen of Heaven.</p>
<p>The two bas relief paintings hanging in our church might have been
inspired by engraving books brought and circulated by Jesuits from
Europe, particularly by the work of the famous Flemish engravers, the
Wierixes.</p>
<div class="fullwidth">
<p><img src="./WierixCr.jpg" style="width:49.0%" alt="Drawing by Hieronymus Wierix" /> <img src="./WierixC0.jpg" style="width:49.0%" alt="Drawing by Hieronymus Wierix" /></p>
<p>Jan and Hieronymus Wierix were part of a Flemish dynasty of
printmakers in the 16th and early 17th centuries. They were active in
Antwerp and Brussels and were associated with the Jesuits in a project
to publish a book of drawings that were intended as working models of
faithful depictions of incidents of the Gospels. These were used widely
in missionary outposts like India and China, and had a considerable
influence on the iconography of local artists and wood carvers. The
prints were finally published in a separate volume from the text in
1593, the <em>Evangelicae Historiae Imagines</em> (“Pictures of the
Gospel Stories”).</p>
</div>
<h2 class="fullwidth">South Bas Relief: Christ Triumphant</h2>
<div class="aside">
<figure>
<img src="./WierixCh.jpg" alt="Drawing by Hieronymus Wierix" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Drawing by Hieronymus Wierix</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>This is the second bas relief that probably came from the Church of
Santa Anna. The carving on the south wall is a representation of
Christ’s triumph over Death and Sin.</p>
<p>Christ Triumphant is portrayed trampling Death - a skeleton wasted
and rotted having spent its every effort in its fight against the
redemption of mankind and holding a broken lance, while the scythe of
Death has slipped from His hand. Sin is represented by an evil gargoyle
being sloughed off the skeleton.</p>
<p>The portrayal uses an array of bright vivid colors that represent
goodness in the form of the resplendent Risen Christ. One can easily
perceive the power that Christ holds over all.</p>
<p>The “Resurrection Cross” (<em>Crux longa</em> ) is a long shaft
crossed at the top from which a white banner floats. Christ bears this
in His hand as His standard of power, and to signify His victory over
Death and Hell.</p>
<h2 class="fullwidth">The Belfry</h2>
<div class="fullwidth">
<p>Two towers flank the facade adding 10 feet on each side to its width.
The north tower serves as the belfry and houses the three bells that
peal out each day to remind the faithful at the times of the Angelus,
three times each day, at sunrise, noon and sunset. The bells are also
rung on festive occasions, as at the Christmas and the Easter
Masses.</p>
</div>
<div class="aside">

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Genelle Alves. 2015.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The large bell is rung to announce a death in the parish, at which
time the tone is more somber. The bells were used down the centuries to
sound an alarm and to call the parishioners to assemble. Tradition has
it that the bells were rung when there was danger to the parish from
marauding pirates, “Moors and Malabaris”, who used to sail in from
Muscat or the Malabar region to plunder our coastal villages. There is a
detailed report of one such attack on February 27th 1700, when an Arab
expedition from Muscat, comprising 2000 men in seven ships, conducted a
raid on Versova where they slaughtered the small Portuguese garrison
before moving southward and ravaging the three coastal villages up to
Bandra. Older parishioners recount hearing from their even older
relatives how on these occasions people used to throw their gold and
jewelry into the village wells and seek temporary refuge in the nearby
hills.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>A more recent occasion when the bells were rung in alarm was in
February 1956 during the 13-hours adoration at the 8 a.m. Mass, when
there was a fire on the main altar. It was a very windy day and the silk
drapes caught fire. A koli woman tolled the church bells and numerous
parishioners, mainly from Chimbai, raced to the church and put off the
blaze well before the fire brigade arrived.</p>
<p>One bell bears the inscription <em>Santo Andre de Bandora 1793</em>,
and is used to announce deaths, the arrival of a funeral cortege at the
church compound and on All Souls Day. This large bell has on its body a
cross within an oval.</p>
<p>Another bell is inscribed <em>Santo Andre Bandora 1869, recast
1900</em>. It is used for the Angelus and on festive occasions.</p>
<p>The largest bell, in the centre of the belfry, inscribed <em>Gogossen
Von Humprt, Brilon</em>, was presented to the church in 1934 by Sir
Dominic Joseph Ferreira, K.C.S.S., in memory of his wife, Josephine. The
installation of this bell is depicted on this page.</p>
<h2 class="fullwidth">The Attic</h2>
<div class="fullwidth">
<p>On March 10th 1861, an entry in the personal diary of a parishioner,
Philip Balthazar Pereira, recorded the completion of the ceiling of the
church. To someone sitting in the nave of the church today, the ceiling,
41 feet above, made of teak boards, provides a neat interface that masks
the visually fascinating grid of teak beams above it that form the
support for the roof of the church. Stout beams of teak wood, hundreds
of years old, weave a lattice of wood over the heads of the faithful
sitting in the pews each day.</p>

<p>One interesting section of this forest of sawed teak has a crossbeam
at the east end where the old church ended. This 4 x 5 inch beam runs
across horizontally for about eight feet. On it is a neat inscription in
Portuguese: “<em>on 5th of April 1823, by Antonio Da Cunha, master
builder, of Manori</em>” attesting to the extensive roof repair work he
conducted.</p>

<h2 class="fullwidth">The Bosco Hall</h2>
<div class="fullwidth">
<p>At one time this building was used as part of the early St Andrew’s
School. Later, when St Andrew’s High School was built, the building
continued to be used as the premises of the St Andrew’s Girls High
School.</p>

<div class="aside">

<p>In the 1950s, the ‘Bosco Club’ was formed as a forum for youth
activities, in what came to be called the ‘Bosco Hall’. It had ‘ping
pong’ tables, carrom and chess boards on the first floor. There was a
Literary section, conducting regular debates and symposia and a Social
section.</p>
<p>The Parish ‘Zonals’ got their start as part of the Bosco Club
activities. The Zonal contests, begun more than sixty years ago as a
forum to nurture talent in the community, continue to develop singing,
instrumental, acting and other skills and has today been expanded to
embrace neighboring parishes - truly a reaffirmation of St Andrew’s in
its role as the mother parish in Bandra.</p>
<p>Today the halls are used for parish meetings, social gatherings and
other functions.</p>
