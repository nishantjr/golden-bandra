      <p>Initially the Portuguese had to walk a tightrope between the Marathas
and the Moghuls with each in turn retaliating because they saw the other
side as being favoured. First they had to placate the Mughals after
Shivaji raided Surat in 1664 and “passed happily to his Kingdom always
keeping to our border in that transit, with the idea of availing himself
of our territory in the event of an emergency” Piss n58 p 152 (citing
Livro das moncoes No 30 p 143). Later the Mughal armies were allowed to
march through Portuguese territory en route to attacking Sambhaji who
then retaliated after the Mughals withdrew. At a still later stage, the
Mughals in turn turned hostile because of perceived support to the
Marathas. As the Maratha state grew stronger they took over all the
territory bordering the Portuguese holdings from Daman to Chaul. The
relations were in three phases of increasing hostility. 1) Initially, in
the 1660s under Shivaji, they claimed rights over some of these lands
which were held by the previous rulers (eg Chauth and Gaonkhandi) and
which were given to them by these rulers. (eg Moghul farmans ) 2) In the
next phase, there were direct attacks and temporary occupation of some
lands in retaliation of perceived support to the mughals but still
related to demands for tribute under Sambhaji 1683-1724 2) In the final
phase, under Baji Rao’s leadership, demands escalated to include freedom
of religion and culminated in campaign to remove Portuguese presence
completely.</p>
<h2>1660s</h2>
<p>In Shivaji’s reign no direct threat to Salcette though Shivaji
captured the surrounding Bijapur territory including Bhiwandi and
Kalyan. He also set up a naval base at Kalyan. He collected ‘gaokhandi’
– a form of quit-rent over some villages (Saibana) near Bassein for some
years.. Payments began around 1665-66. The Portuguese themselves
collected the ‘trench’ and notified the maratha subedars – in this case
a Moro Trimbal Pradhan - to collect it rather than allow the Marathas
directly to do so. Piss n116 p53 N.B. Not ‘chauth’ which he claimed in
area near Daman.</p>
<h2>1683</h2>
<p>Sambhaji retaliated after Portuguese allowed a Moghul army through
its territory and threatened Salcette. British records say that ’
…Cambar, Tullojah and Colwah (were) taken .. and expect every hour to
hour to hear of Thanah and Salcette being in his possession. Piss n 478

most of the Portuguese took much territory north of Bassein like Mahim,
Quelme..Soparah and burnt Sabage.. is landed on Carinja ..we can see no
hopes for them, but the Moghul’s army falling down into the Konkan. Piss

<p>Letter of Viceroy; 7 January 1694 Siddy of Danda (a vassal of the
Moghuls) is preparing 80 warships to attack the island of Salcette, in
the jurisdiction of Bassein. The news further says that the tillers and
the residents of the villages, with the fear of the imminent attack have
deserted the villages and have taken shelter in the forts. Immediately
on receipt of these news I ordered Belchoir de Amaral de Menezes, chief
captain of the Northern Fleet, to go in support of those shores and to
impeded any attempt at landing thereon made by the enemy. It is
confirmed to me by many persons coming from there, that the aid had
reached in the appropriate time and that had I not been careful to
dispatch it promptly the enemy would, undoubtedly, succeed… Piss p 161

<p>Under Baji Rao, the Marathas mow coveted the North Province “The
lands forming this province were wide, most fertile …They were the best
patrimony of the State on account of the quit-rent and revenue received
from the factories within, as well as on account of the income pocketed
by the vassals of His Majesty and by the tenants of those lands. …The
island of Salcette which is to the south of the Fort of Bassein was the
most precious terrain of the region for the quality of the land, as well
as, for the security afforded by her rivers around it. But the
jurisdictions of Bassain, Saibana, Sabap, Manori, Asseri, Tarapore and
Daman were open lands bordering upon the dominion of Marathas on the
side of Kalyan and Bhiwandi. They were therefore unable to resist
against the invasion of the Marathas who repeatedly invaded them for the
loot of cattle and other property of agriculturalists. Fear and feelings
of necessity were created among these agriculturalists to leave their
villages for those in Maratha territory…the Province of the North …came
down to a shameful decline owing to the repeated hostilities by the
Marathas..Piss p 170</p>

<p>Fresh outbreak of hostilities: letter of Governor of Bombay to
Krishnarao Mahadev, Fauzdar of Kalyan re “hostilities from either side
causing great damage to the poor residents and interruption to the trade

doubled garrisons of forts especially Thana. But still too weak against

a force of 700 men because of which the ” enemies gave up the plan to
pass to the island of Salcette”. Piss p 174 Letter of Viceroy to King 19

April captured dry pass to Thana and Thana fort was occupied on 8th
April. Army broke up into two columns to Versova and Bandra</p>
<p>On 9th April the enemies continued the hostilities in and attacks on
the same island of Salsette. They destined 500 men to attack the fort
that defended the part of Versova…. The same happened at that very
moment in the public house of Bandra (Bandora) that was garrisoned by
priests of the Company, its masters. This house was protected by two
moon-shaped out-works. These priests brought men from Bombay – at their
own cost. However a little later thereafter Lieutenant General Caetano
De Souza Pereira, a noble of known valour, reached the Fort of Versova
with an aid of 30 soldiers and Chief Captain of Salsette, Joao de Souza
Ferras, an official of good judgment reached Bandra with an equal number
of men. They were sent by General Dom Luis Bottelho from Karanja. These
precautions ensured better security of that fort. Piss p. 189</p>
<p>They continued the attacks on Bandra and Versova p 191</p>
<p>All the while the struggle of defence if the strong house of Bandora
(Bandra) continued firmly. It was surrounded persistently by enemies
since 10th April. The enemies when found their initial plan to scale the
walls frustrated, with a considerable loss, took up top attack the two
small watch points that guarded the fortress. This attack was carried
out by two persons of artillery. However, the Chief Captain Joao de
Souza Ferra who could show the enemies the valour he was gifted with,
promptly made the enemies see his disposition and consistency in the
remaining operations that followed. He, availing himself of the facility
of carrying the necessary aid from Bombay, afford by the nearness of the
island and the good will of the Britons on account of the ready payment
and an account of their desire to avoid the Marathas in close vicinity,
ordered out, from there, some artillery of heavy caliber and other
material the he felt to be useful for the defence. With counter attacks
he enhanced the damage to the enemies. He perturbed them by artificial
fire and frustrated them in their last resort of mining operations by
planting counter mines. The enemies suffered a heavy mortality during
the course of fifty six days of the siege and having no hope to better
the lot withdrew on 5th June. During the process of withdrawal, the set
fire to the Church of St. Andre, Chapel of Nossa Senhora de Monserrate
and to the entire village. This did not cause loss to defenders except
six dead and some wounded Piss pp 199-200 <strong>Check Oriente

<p>The consistency that the enemies experienced in the defence of the
small and tenuous fortifications of Bandora (Bandra) and Versova, in the
same island made them realize that the success they had in capturing the
forts of the firm land was not due to the lack of valour of the
defenders but was due to many other faults such as unprepared ness for
an abruptly and unexpected war with no aid as that received by Bandora
and Versova which had sea ports which facilitated communication with
Bombay and Bassein. Piss p 203</p>
<h2>1738-1739</h2>
<p>Bandora could have been lost to the Marathas if it had not been
timely supported with men and ammunition by the Englishmen who were also
interested in its defence. The book Cartas e Ordens (Letters and Orders
No. 23 p 58) gives a list of arms, ammunition and other war material
supplied to Bandra By the Englishmen of Bombay for the defence of the
fort. This list also gives the list of the persons who were present in
the strong house of Bandra on 13th February 173 {P iss n19- 20 p 243-44
See Xerox of pp244-45</p>
<p>There are references to British decision to provide support in April
1737 A resolution of 28-3-’37 said: “It is therefore agreed that we send
them (the Portuguese) an officer and fifty men, if the place (Bandra) is
found tenable….” (Selections, Home Series, II, p. 68). Ranwar Source p

<p>BUT Marathas entered Salcette only on 6th April though an attack
seemed to have been expected. More probably the Resolution is of 1738 as
appears from below. There is reference to charges for the men in 1738
though it could refer only to pending charges</p>

<p>The 18th January 1739 the account charges for Bandra from 1st August
1738 to 31st December following amounting to Rs. 9795-3-64, translated
into Portuguese, are laid before the Board, when the President takes
notice that the Portuguese Government had not even cleared the arrears
of the four preceding months from 1st April to 31st July amounting to
Rs. 6,893-2-21. [Bom Gov. Consultation, 18 Jan. 1739 Pub Diary 13 of

<div class="comment">
<p>A stronger argument for the British not having been involved in the
actual fighting is the correspondence between Khodaji Mankar, commanding
general in Salcette, and the British in 1739 regarding the Maratha
intention to take Bandra and warning the British to withdraw else
relations would be strained if it came to actual fighting:</p>
</div>
<p>Next day (19th January, 1739) the President communicated to the Board
a letter received from Kondaji Mankar the commanding officer on the
island of Salsette for the Marathas, the substance of which is to
acquaint him that Chimnaji brother to Bajirav has reduced Mahim (Kalve),
Kellum (Kalve), and Dahanu and was bent on subduing the remainder of the
country. That this early and frank advice was given us of his intention
to attack Vesava and Bandra, that we might withdraw our succours from
the latter place where they are in garrison and which they look on as
their right and belonging to their domain, and even offering on the
reduction of Bandra if we are jealous of a troublesome neighbourhood, to
agree to its demolition. In case of our continuance in Bandra he says he
cannot answer for the consequences that may result to the peaceable
correspondence we have hitherto maintained with them. Another
possibility is that the Portuguese reinforcements went to the battery
fortifications at the foot of the hill and the English were at
St. Anne’s. Hence all the fighting would have been at the battery. The
Marathas also agreed to the demolition of the fortifications if that was
what the British wanted</p>
<p>The British however decided to ” maintain and continue our succours
to the fortification of Bandra, which we judge may hold out against the
Marathas unless they bring cannons against it. In such case the place
being no longer tenable, that care shall be taken to secure the retreat
of our people and a mine be sprung for its being rendered unserviceable
to the Marathas. Of this the President is desired to advise the General
of the North and at the same time of the indispensable necessity of
demolishing the battery at the foot of the hill of Senora de Monte on
Salsette which entirely commands the channel that gives passage into the
Mahim river.</p>
