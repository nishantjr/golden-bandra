      House, one of the older buildings in the heart of Ranwar, photographed
      here as it stood up until around 1999. The present structure was built in
      1841. (The carved wooden plaque above, was embedded in the wall over the
      main entrance of the house. The IHS symbollises ‘Christ’ and below it,
      the three nails used to crucify Christ, pierce His heart symbolically).</font>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">This rambling, spacious bungalow was
      typical of the buildings in villages like Ranwar. It had a quaint veranda,
      with two plain teak benches and wrought iron railings, where passers by
      used to drop in to chat during the day or evening. The rooms were large
      and airy and the high wooden ceiling, held a loft that extended through
      the building. There was a wide garden to the east and a sprawling compound
      behind the bungalow with two large outhouses, a huge, gnarled tamarind
      tree, over a hundred years old, an equally tall jambool tree and several
      coconut palms.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">The property was sold to a developer
      and the original building was demolished at the start of the new
      millennium.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">A photograph shows the partly
      demolished building with the rooms exposed. The walls were constructed
      using bricks and white limestone <i>ladhis </i>that were typical of the
      area. The loft floor and the roof were constructed using solid teak beams
      that withstood the ravages of time and termites but finally gave way to
      development in the form of a multistoryed concrete and steel behemoth.</font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">Despite its inappropriate location
      in a gaothan and heritage area the multi-unit apartment stands as stark
      evidence of the pressures which villages like Ranwar, Pali, Sherly and
      Rajan are subject to. The sewer lines, laid in the 1920s were never
      intended for the huge number of housing units that now have sprung up,
      with the result that the drains perennially clog and back up. The narrow
      lanes cannot handle the vastly increased through-traffic and the parking
      spaces required to accommodate resident vehicles, so that the quiet
      street, reflecting widespread changes in Bandra, is a chaotic, noisy
      thoroughfare with traffic jams occurring at bottlenecks, several times
      each day.</font></p>
