Articles Contributed
</h3>
We welcome articles from parishioners and people connected with St Andrewâ€™s Parish. These can be any appropriate articles of interest to the Parish, - preferably connected with people, matters and events in the parish. 

We would very much like you to permit us to mention your name along with the articles. 

For various reasons we cannot post articles 'live' but will do so as rapidly as we can. In the event that the WebTeam feels that there is need for editing material contributed we will do so, keeping in mind that the content substance should remain intact.
