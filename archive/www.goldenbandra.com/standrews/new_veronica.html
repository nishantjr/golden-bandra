The ‘T’ community of our poarish is located on New Veronica Road. This Community 
consists of 80 families and its patron is the Holy Trinity. 
<br><br>
<u>October 2003</u><br> During the month of Ocotber, we recited the Rosary everyday in Blue 
Bell where our non-Catholic bretheren came daily to pray as well. Their intentions were 
also prayed for.  We had a small fellowship on the last day of the month, where everyone 
brought something making it enjoyable. Some families also took part in the Rosary 
pilgrimage to the Mount and also attended the closing ceremony at St. Stanislaus. 
<br><br>
<u>December 2003</u><br> With the preparation for Christmas, it was decided to defer our annual 
thanksgiving / get-together to January 2004. </P></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
