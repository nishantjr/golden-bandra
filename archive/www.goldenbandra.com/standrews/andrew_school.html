<B>The Principal of  St.Andrew’s School </B>
<BR><BR>
The school got its recognition in the year 1915 and the first batch was sent up for the 
Maticualtion Examination in the year 1920-21. The school, however, has exitsted prior to 
this date. At its inception, it functioned in the current Bosco Hall, adjacent to 
St.Andrew’s Church.
<BR><BR>
The motto of the school is ‘UBI CRUX IBI LUX’ which means where there is the cross 
there is light and this has been a motivation and driving force for the staff and students.
<BR><BR>
The school has been considered to be the oldest  school and has formed great men of 
character, securing coveted positions in all walks of life – sports, acting, governing, 
medical fields and engineering. 
<BR><BR>
The current principal Mrs.Genevieve G. Tauro has been associated with the school for 
the last 24 years. The last 2 years being the served as a Head-Mistress.
<BR><BR>
The school has been patronised by the parishioners in the past and at present too with the 
catholics making up only around 10-15% of the students. She feels that there should be 
more participation from the parishioners. Her vision for the school is for multi-
dimensional progress in all spheres of school life.
<BR><BR>
The percentage of students passing has been 94% in the last SSC examinations and has 
swayed between 91-100% in the last few years.
<BR><BR>
One of the most memorable moments for her has been when Ex-Principals reposed their 
trust in her and appointed her as the Headmistress of the school especially since she was 
the first woman to be the principal of the school in it’s long history. Also when the 
Alumni presented her with a plaque “Plaque of a life-time”. Apart from these when the 
students have done exemplary deeds has been a source of great joy.
<BR><BR>
The one thing that she would like to change about the school is improved performance at 
all levesl by doing little jobs well and painstakingly.
