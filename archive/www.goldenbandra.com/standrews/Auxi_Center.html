<h3>Auxilium Centre</h3>

<P>The Salesian Sisters of Don Bosco
established the Auxilium Centre in Bandra in the year 1988. With our

realized that there are a number of young girls from the tribal
pockets of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Chattisgarh and Bengal
who come to Mumbai in search of employment as domestics. Many of them
come on their own or with others and in the first few days live in
very insecure and unsafe situations. We the sisters are in the
process of exploring the possibility of assisting these girls to
finds a secure and safe employment.</P>
