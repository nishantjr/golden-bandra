    <TD width="100%" colSpan=2>The Agna Square SCC is located off Waroda Road 
      and west of Ranwar. Agna Square is an 'old world' pocket surrounded by 
      tiled bungalows and connected to the outside world by narrow winding 
      gullies. These lanes are lined by houses on either side, so close together 
      that they are not accessible to motor cars, with the result that Agna 
      Square remains an uncluttered, if small, space in a crowded neighbourhood. 

      <P>There are 24 families in this close knit community and till today the 
      sense of closeness is more than merely physical. Each neighbour is aware 
      of happenings in the area and equally willing to help and get involved. 
      </P>
      <P>This is a very close knit community and residents remember the days when life was more relaxed and people spent 
      long hours each day lounging in their 'oatlas' and chatting with passing 
      friends - rather than rushing from appointment to meeting, or sprawled 
      indoors in front of TV sets or computers.</P>
      <P>The small, 50 x 50 ft square is used for community Masses and 
      functions. Housie is often conducted by the youth who also set up a 
      community crib in a corner of the Agna Square, each December.</P>
