<P>As mentioned earlier Bandra came into the possession of the
Jesuits in the year 1570. In a letter written on 15th December, 1575,
a Jesuit says that there are three of them in Bandra and that 200
persons had been baptized in that year. In 1580, over 2000 were
baptized and in 1616 there were 6000 Catholics in Bandra - nearly the
entire population.</P>
<P>The new Christians assumed the surname of the Priest who baptized
them or of the sponsor. Other aspects of their life did not change,
e.g. they continued to speak their dialect of Marathi, carried on
with their traditional occupations, dress, diet, etc. The reports of
those days extol the faith of the Christians of Bandra.</P>

<P>The first Oratory to be built in Bandra was the one on a hill
which is now the renowned 'Mount Mary'. This oratory was built by the
Jesuits in around 1573.</P>
<P>Between 1577 and 1583, the Jesuits built a residence by the creek
with a Chapel attached, which served as a parish Church. However, it
was not a parish Church in the strict sense of the term, as the
Jesuit Catalogue for this year states that Fr. Manoel Gomes S.J. was
'in charge'. A few years later, (certainly by the year 1590), it
became a parish Church, for we are informed that Fr. Gomes is its
Vicar.</P>

<P><A HREF="#top|region">Top of Page</A></P>
<P>Fr. Nuno Rodrigues S.J., who was the Jesuit Provincial from 1597 -
1602 ordered the new parish Church of Bandra to be built. This Church
was dedicated to St. Anne and was built adjacent to the Jesuit
residence which was situated south of where the present BEST depot is
- next to the Bandra Railway Station. The Church stood on the Bandra
side of the creek facing St. Michael Church which stood on the Mahim
side of the creek.</P>
<P>We have a description of this Church in the Jesuit report of 1669.
It says, &quot;in the island of Salsette, there is a church under the
invocation of St. Anne. The village is in the lowest (the southern
most) path of the island at the point nearest to the island of Mahim.
This church is very old and is one of the most beautiful in these
parts; it is also very big, although the faithful became so numerous,
that the Fathers of the Society had to build another church under the
invocation of St. Andrew near the sea. Notwithstanding this, the
parish of St. Anne had 3000 faithful. On the church of St. Anne,
depended the hermitage of Our Lady of the Mount. The feast is
celebrated each year on the 8th of September, the feast of the
Nativity of Our Lady. The Parish Priest of St. Anne's goes there
every week (on Wednesdays) to say Mass for the people who flock there
in great numbers out of devotion to their Mother&quot;.</P>
<P>The St. Anne Church was dynamited by the English engineers on 25th
March, 1739. What was the reason for this? During the
Maratha-Portuguese war (1737-1739) the English feared that if the
Marathas captured Bandra they would have a strategic location along
side the creek and on the hill at Bandra. From these places they
could fire at the English who were at the Mahim side of the creek.
Their position would be stronger if they captured St. Anne Church for
it was with a fortification equipped with guns. Therefore, the
English were of the opinion that it should be destroyed and insisted
on it being done before they helped the Portuguese against the
Marathas.</P>
<P>(St. Andrew Church, Bandra, possesses two treasures from the
extinct St. Anne Church : A 17 foot monolithic Cross and a Baptismal
Register - details of which can be found elsewhere on this website)</P>

</DIV>
<P><A HREF="#top|region">Top of Page</A></P>
<P>Centuries ago the present St. Andrew Church was a hermitage. We do
not know the year of its foundation but we know that it existed in
1601, for in that year, Pope Clement VIII, &quot;granted an
indulgence of 20 years and 40 days to the faithful who, after going
to confession and receiving Holy Communion, would visit on Maundy
Thursday, from the rising of the sun to its setting on the following
day, the hermitages of Mount Mary's and St. Andrew's&quot;.</P>
<P>In the year 1616, as the Church of St. Anne had 6000 parishioners,
a new parish was formed, that of St. Andrew. Perhaps, it was at this
time that a church replaced the hermitage.</P>
<P>In 1739, when St. Anne Church was destroyed, St. Andrew Church was
the only Church in Bandra and the parish comprised of the entire
Bandra and the adjacent areas. During the Maratha period (1739-1775)
St. Andrew Church continued to function as usual. In fact, it was the
venue of the ordination of a Bishop - the earliest in Bombay as far
as the records go.</P>

<P>In the 19th century, St. Peter Church and Mount Carmel Church were
built. Initially, these churches did not have a territorial parish
but a personal jurisdiction.</P>
<P>In the 20th century, the following parishes were carved out of St.
Andrew parish :</P>
<P> &uml; St. Theresa, Bandra &uml; St. Anne, Pali Hill, Bandra &uml;
St. Vincent de Paul, Chuim, Bandra, now in Khar

	<P> The Church Building</P>
</DIV>
<P><A HREF="#top|region">Top of Page</A></P>
<P>The original dimensions of the church were 100 feet in length and
42 feet in breadth. Originally the church did not have a porch.
However, a large wooden, artistic porch was added in the year 1890,
which was subsequently demolished in 1965.</P>
<P>In 1965, the fa&ccedil;ade of the church was demolished and the
church was extended by 75 feet thus giving it a length of 175 feet.
The new fa&ccedil;ade was a replica of the old one. This was the
first major alteration in the many centuries of the church's
existence. This extension was blessed and opened by His Eminence
Valerian Cardinal Gracias, Archbishop of Bombay on 20th February,
1996. This extension was possible due to the determination and
untiring efforts of the Parish Priest, Msgr. George Fernandes.</P>

<DIV ID="altar" DIR="LTR"><A NAME="altar|region"></A>
	<P> The Altars</P>
</DIV>
<P><A HREF="#top|region">Top of Page</A></P>
<P>The original main altar had the twelve apostles. St. Andrew was
given the first place. This altar was destroyed by white ants and was
replaced by the present altar in 1906 - &quot;built on a brick base
paved with marble and which extends almost to the roof&quot;. The
present altar has three niches - the Sacred Heart and our Lady in the
two outer niches with the statue of St. Andrew in the central niche.
Above these are three smaller niches with statues of St. John the
Baptist and St. Sebastian and the third one a little higher
containing the statue of the Bom Jesu.</P>
<P>Both the side altars are the original altars built of wood in the
sixteenth century, carved and painted in the popular Portuguese style
of that period called the Flamboyant. The north side altar has the
statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary with Baby Jesus in her left arm.</P>

	<P> The Pulpit</P>
</DIV>
<P><A HREF="#top|region">Top of Page</A></P>
<P>The beautifully carved pulpit is of great historical significance
as well, since it is also the original one of the sixteenth century.
Carved to resemble a flower on a stalk it has seven sepals that turn
outward and are held together by angels. On each petal is a carving
representing the prophets of the Old Testament. Above hangs a canopy
with the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove carved on it. Old
parishioners remember the stone steps leading to the pulpit from the
outside which were demolished and walled in when the church was being
extended and steps built from the inside of the church, necessitating
the removal of two of the beautifully carved panels.</P>

</DIV>
<P><A HREF="#top|region">Top of Page</A></P>
<P>Two original wood panels above the two front doors depicting the
Resurrection of Christ and the Assumption of Mary Immaculate are also
of sixteenth century origin. The Resurrection scene shows Christ
trampling over death represented by a skeleton that is wasted and
rotted, thus showing the triumph of Christ's redemption of mankind
over death and sin. The Assumption of Our Lady into heaven is
depicted by a crown held over head by the hands of God, the Father
and God the Son, while the Holy Spirit hovers above. It is
interesting to note that the representation of the Assumption of Our
Lady was already part of religious art even before the dogma of the
Assumption became the Magisterium of the church. (See 'Pictorials'
for a visual of the panels)</P>

	<P> The Bells</P>
</DIV>
<P><A HREF="#top|region">Top of Page</A></P>
<P>On either side of the fa&ccedil;ade the two towers which
originally flanked it were demolished and new ones, having stained
glass windows were built with the new fa&ccedil;ade when the church
was extended. The base of the north tower now accommodates the
stairway to the choir. The base o the other two houses the Baptistery
whose stained glass window has been recently restored. The bells that
was first kept in the window facing east is the oldest. It bears the
inscription &quot;SANTRO ANDRE DE BANDORA, 1793&quot; around the
outside of the rim and on the body is a cross in an oval. It was used
to announce deaths, arrival of funerals at the church and on All
Souls Day. The bell that was kept in the window facing north has the
inscription partly in Portuguese and partly in English : SANTO DE
ANDRE BANDORA, 1869. RECAST 1900&quot;. This was used for the Angelus
and to summon the faithful to service and on festive occasions. The
largest bell in the center of the belfry is of more recent origin,
being presented in 1934 by Sir Dominic Joseph Ferreira, K.C.S.S. in
memory of his wife Josephine. It was cast by Gossen Von Humpert,
Brilon, and was used daily at 8.30 p.m. &quot;to remind the faithful
to pray for the departed souls, for the Angelus, and on festive
occasions&quot;. All three bells are now in the new north tower.</P>

<DIV ID="Cross" DIR="LTR"><A NAME="Cross|region"></A>
	<P>An Ancient Monolithic Cross</P>
</DIV>
<P><A HREF="#top|region">Top of Page</A></P>
<P>One of the largest and oldest Crosses in Mumbai and the adjoining
areas, stands in the compound of St. Andrew Church, Bandra. It is
situated adjacent to the southern wall (Hill Road side), south of the
church fa&ccedil;ade and west of the Grotto.</P>
<P>This Cross is 17 feet in height and is carved from a single block
of stone. The sides of the Cross that face the west and east have
carvings of symbols from the Old Testament and the New Testament.
(See 'Pictorials' for a visual of the Cross)</P>
<P>This Cross was originally in the compound of the extinct St. Anne
Church - the first Church of Bandra (details of which are given
above). After this Church was destroyed in 1739, this Cross was
shifted to St. Andrew Church compound. In 1870, it was installed on a
high pedestal where it remains till today.</P>
<P>This monolithic centuries-old Cross symbolises the Catholic faith
in Bandra.</P>
<DIV ID="statue" DIR="LTR"><A NAME="statue|region"></A>
	<P>An Historic Statue</P>
</DIV>
<P><A HREF="#top|region">Top of Page</A></P>
<P>One of the 'side altars' of St. Andrew Church, Bandra, has a niche
with a large wooden statue of Mary carrying the Child Jesus. This
statue is not particularly graceful or artistic but it is of
historical value.</P>
<P>The Annual Jesuit letter of the year 1669 tells us that it is an
image of 'Our Lady of the Navigators' . Initially one may be
surprised at this title for the statue does not have any symbol of or
association with 'navigation'.</P>
<P>However, the Jesuit letter explicitly states the fishermen found a
statue in the sea, off the Bandra coast. Perhaps, this statue was
enshrined in a Portuguese ship and fell into the sea during a storm
or shipwreck.</P>
<P>This is the only statue that was found in the sea according to
records presently available. It is likely, according to a writer,
that this fact has been transferred to the statue of Our Lady of the
Mount.</P>
<P>The statue of Our Lady of Navigators on the side altar of St.
Andrew Church, Bandra had a silver crown, which was stolen a few
decades ago. This crown had an inscription, which was quite
intriguing. It read &quot;In the Samvat year 1816 on the 8th day of
the waning moon (after full moon) in the month of Shravan
(August-September) two silver crowns were made for Nossa Senhora do
Monte and the child by Dharma Patel, Thalkai, Koli, Naratha, in
fulfillment of a promise made through Vaghset. D. 1760&quot; (please
note that 1816 according to the Samvat year is approximately
equivalent to 1760 of the Christian era.)</P>
<P>Although this crown was presented for use on the statue of Our
Lady of Navigators, and made keeping that size in mind, yet the
inscription says that it was made for the statue of Our Lady of the
Mount (which would need a smaller crown). Did the donor make a
mistake? Was Our Lady of Navigators also referred to as Our Lady of
the Mount? No satisfactory explanation has been offered for this.</P>

</DIV>
<P><A HREF="#top|region">Top of Page</A></P>
<P>In the center of the fa&ccedil;ade is a small hole just above the
statue of St. Andrew, which you may not have noticed, or never given
a thought as to why it was there. Its purpose: to let the rising sun
shine through the church to give us a Solar Phenomenon which has been
researched and documented by Carlisle Curry presented in a Supplement
to the Andrean Notes of 1st July, 1989.</P>
<P>This phenomenon is 390 years old and still occurs twice a year on
the days of the Equinox. Inside the church the sun shines on the
keystone of the arch inside the church which separates the sanctuary
from the main altar exactly at 7 a.m. on 21st and 22nd March (the
Vernal Equinox) and on 22nd and 23rd September (Autumnal Equinox).
This phenomenon still occurs twice every year.</P>

<DIV ID="Consecration" DIR="LTR"><A NAME="Consecration|region"></A>
	<P>The Consecration of Bandra to Christ the King</P>
</DIV>
<P><A HREF="#top|region">Top of Page</A></P>
<P>The idea of consecrating Bandra to Christ the King was initiated
by the Very Rev. Fr. Dominic de Sa (Parish Priest, St. Andrew Church)
who received the fullest co-operation from the Vicar of St. Peter's
Church, Fr. Cassassayas, S.J. and Fr. John Gomes, Vicar of Mount
Carmel's Church. Preparations for the occasion were started months
ahead with the formation of an Organising Committee. On the evening
before the great day an Academy on the Kingship of Christ presided
over by H.E. The Delegate Apostolic, the Most Rev. Dr. Leo R.
Kierkels, C.P. was held in St. Peter's Church compound. The
Archbishop of Bombay, the Most Rev. Dr. Joaquim R. Lima, S.J. and the
Prefect Apostolic of Kashmir, Msgr. Joseph Donohoe also graced the
occasion.</P>
<P>On Sunday, 3rd February, 1935, the Delegate Apostolic sang the
Pontifical High Mass in St. Andrew Church, after which the Blessed
Sacrament was exposed for continuous adoration. The evening service
was one of unparalleled splendour and magnificence with about 20,000
people participating. After the sermon by Rev. Dr. L. Raymond the
Blessed Sacrament was borne in procession along Hill Road southward
to Supali (Supari) Tank for Benediction. The procession continued
along Chapel Road, St. Peter's Road and Hall Road, back to St.
Andrew's. The Delegate Apostolic gave the sermon on Christ the King;
then the Act of Consecration was read by Ref. Fr. D. de Sa. After
Benediction the crowds were regaled to a display of fireworks. The
monument to commemorate this event was designed by Mrs. Lourdes Netto
and the pedestal by Mr. Robert Athogias. A special hymn to &quot;Christ
the King&quot; was composed by Mr. Sally Athogias.</P>
<P>The Silver Jubilee of this event was celebrated on 7th February
1960. Fifty motorcyclists and scooters from Bandra escorted His
Eminence Valerian Cardinal Gracias, from Mahim Causeway to St. Andrew
Church where His Eminence was received by the parish Priest, Papal
Knights and papal Medallists who led the procession into the Church
while the choir sang &quot;Ecce Sacrdos Magnus&quot;. After
Pontifical Mass sung by His Eminence, the Blessed Sacrament was
exposed for adoration the whole day. The evening ceremony was yet
another memorable occasion. The procession with the Blessed Sacrament
on a decorated float led to St. Peter's Church compound for
Benediction, then along Chapel Road to Mount Carmel's Church compound
and back to St. Andrew's along Mount Carmel Road and Hill Road. After
the sermon by His Eminence, Msgr. Henry Remedios read the Act of
Consecration. Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament brought the
ceremony to a close.</P>

<P>The 2-mile long torch-light procession of about 60,000 persons to
the Shrine of Our Lady of the Mount, chanting the Rosary and the Ave,
the infinite beauty of the Magnificat at her enthronement in the

the procession wended its way through the decorated Veronica Street,
Waroda Road, Hill Road, St. Paul Road, Perry Cross Road, into
Cantawadi Schme, through Chimbai Village to St. Andrew Church.</P>
<P>It was placed in the centre of the sanctuary before the main altar

throne on the Hill.</P>
