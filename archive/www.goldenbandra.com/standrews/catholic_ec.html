<h3>The Catholic Enquiry Centre</h3>
<P>
The Andrean Notes of 1971 August wrote - "The Catholic Enquiry Centre has
been working over the last 12 years under the auspices of the Men's Sodality
of St.Andrew's.  "The Apostolate of the Post" comprises spreading the faith
through correspondence courses mailed to non-Christian enquirers.  This isan 
effective method of reaching into the homes of our non-Christian brotherswho 
otherwise would never have heard the Word of God.  The laity here takean active 
part in the preaching of the Gospel through the Meet Christbooklets.In the first 
place,  the Centre is much indebted to the Parsi friends for afree advertisement 
to local weekly through which the inquirers request forthe course.  In these 
dozen years we have touched the 10,000 mark ofcontacts to whom the Meet Christ 
booklets have been mailed.  In thisApostolic task we are assisted by an 
enthusiastic laity who sacrifice time,money and energy to spread the faith.  The 
Catholic Enquiry Centre began in1959 and continues to work from St. Andrew's 
parish.  A band of dedicatedworkers mail booklets to people of other faiths who 
desire to know moreabout Christ. Mr Vernon Rosario, who very recently expired, 
had tirelesslyserved the CEC over the years.Society".</P>
