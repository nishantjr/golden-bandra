<P>The Laity called to sanctify the world</P>
<P>1.Laity People of God</P>
<P>2.The Church  the Mystical Body of Christ  Pius XII (Mystici
Corporii) Pius XII wrote in an encyclical Mystici Corporis which
emphasized that the Church is the Body of Christ and a person by
virtue of Baptism and Confirmation is incorporated into the Mystical 
Body of Christ and shares in the triple office of Christ i.e. Priest,
Prophet and King. This was reaffirmed in the Vatican II document (LG
31)</P>
<P>3.Charisms  each adding a little for the greater glory of God
revealing a little of the face of God</P>
<P>4.Call to evangelise in our own sphere with the spirit of the
Risen Lord</P>
<P>5.Every person has his/her own place and dignity</P>
<P>6.Each of us  different yet complementary</P>
<P>7.Man and woman  different yet complementary (JP II Mulieris
Dignitatem)</P>
<P>The issue of  women&rsquo;s rights has acquired a new meaning in
the vast context of rights of the human person.   Pope John Paul ll,
a great defender of women, referred to the majestic recital of
Creation: God created mankind - man and woman - in his image and
likeness. (Gn1:27)  Thus both these two beings of different sex share
the same original essence. Consequently woman is not a &lsquo;degenerated
man&rsquo; but an original creative idea of God In Mulieris
Dignitatem, JP II speaks that the Equality  should not lead to the
Masculinity of women.</P>
<P>8.Ministers in the church administer sacraments to infuse and
rejuvenate the love of God and help us to experience the grace of God</P>
<P>9.The laity need to have a strong foundation in theology and the
teachings of the Church 
</P>
<P>10.Family the foundation  a replica of the Church. Values need to
be inculcated at home to lay the foundation for the mission in the
world.</P>
<P>11.The most important  vocation and mission of the laity in the
Church and World  called to sanctify the world from within and Leaven
of society. The Laity is the church&rsquo;s bridge to the modern
world said Paul VI, because he/she brings Christianity to the market
place.  Any change in society is initiated by the laity, as they play
an important role in transforming the body of Christ and also the
contemporary world. Cardinal John Henry Newman has said, In all
times, the laity has been the measure of the Catholic Spirit. Formed
and committed laity are the carriers of the Catholic Spirit. Since
the laity, in accordance with their state of life, live in the midst
of the world and its concerns, they are called by God to exercise
their apostolate in the world like leaven, with the ardour of the
spirit of Christ.

<P><U>Homily by the Sea &ndash; Sacred Heart Feast 18<SUP>th</SUP>
June 2004</U></P>
<P>The sacred heart represents God&rsquo;s infinite love. There are
many beautiful dimensions of this radiant and all encompassing love.
oday, on the feast of the sacred heart, allow me to focus on one
aspect of this great big wonderful love.</P>
<P>The love of the shepherd for his smallest sheep&hellip; the
forgotten sheep&hellip; the insignificant chap, the guy who does not
belong&hellip; the lost sheep.In today&rsquo;s reading St Luke&rsquo;s
in Chapter 15 says, &ldquo;Then Jesus told them a parable. Suppose
one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. Does he not
leave the ninety-nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep
until he finds it? And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his
shoulders and goes home.&rdquo;</P>
<P>Jesus recognized people&rsquo;s insecurities and rushed to
reassure them.</P>
<P>Simon, he said, they call you a flake, but I call you the
Rock.Another time he said, &ldquo;Mary Magdalene, they say you are
worthy of death but I say you are worthy of life&rdquo; And yet
another time: &ldquo;Do not push the children back. They should be in
the center.<BR>Or take Zacchaeus. &ldquo;Zacchaeus, come down from
that tree. I want to have dinner at your house tonight&rdquo; This
request gave Zacchaeus a tremendous boost in public stature. He was a
man who was so short that he had to climb up a tree to see Jesus. In
the book Jesus CEO, Laurie Beth Jones says &ldquo;I wonder if Jesus
wasn&rsquo;t given a choice of transportation into Jerusalem. Perhaps
Elijah got white horses, but may be Jesus thought the donkey could
use a little boost of self esteem.<BR>To me, sacred heart means to be
heartened, to be encouraged, given new spirit. There are so many
disheartened and dispirited people in the world today that it is
evident that the world has tremendous need for healing. <BR>The
infinite love of the sacred heart as revealed in Jesus is his love
for people in the shadows. The ones nobody wanted to dance with. He
dined with the elite, but he lived with the little guys. Jesus was
sensitive to the unloved because he knew what it was like to be
considered an outsider. He knew what it felt to be spat at,
mislabeled and verbally and physically abused.</P>
<P>Today we feast on this outpouring of Christ&rsquo;s healing and
empathetic love.</P>
<P>In one of his speeches, Mahatma Gandhi said, &ldquo;When you are
feeling down, when you think the world is sitting heavy on your
shoulders, when you feel self pity, I urge you to think of the
poorest man you have met, and in focusing on him, you will feel your
troubles wash away in an instant. Like Gandhiji, Jesus was always
looking out for and protecting the little ones.The smallest man is
the message of the feast of the Sacred Heart.<BR>It is after all the
small insignificant people in the large part of India that overthrew
the last government just a few weeks ago. It is the power of the
forgotten people of greater India that put the new government in
power.<BR><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>The good shepherd is the master of his sheep, but he is also the
servant.The shepherd is us, in the role of parents at home, as bosses
at work, as prefects, monitors and class reps in schools and
colleges, and as teachers and professors.</P>
<P>There&rsquo;s a beautiful poem by Rudyard Kipling that best sums
up the true meaning of the day<BR><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<BR>Or walk with
kings--nor lose the common touch,<BR>If neither foes nor loving
friends can hurt you;<BR>If all men count with you, but none too
much,<BR>If you can fill the unforgiving minute<BR>With sixty
seconds' worth of distance run,<BR>Yours is the Earth and everything
that's in it,<BR>And--which is more--you'll be a Man, my son!</P>
