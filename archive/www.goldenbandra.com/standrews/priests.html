	Fr. Rodney Esperance</B></U></P>
	<P>A resident of
	Bandra itself, was originally from Mt.Carmel's parish and did his
	schooling from St.Stanislaus High School. He joined the priesthood
	at a very young age of 16 years !! way back in 1953. He always
	wanted to become a priest.</P>
	<P>He was the
	principal in 11 schools, a fact few of us are aware of. A very
	memorable and great achievement for him would be &quot;Sacred Heart
	School- Worli&quot; where he completely transformed and brought up
	the school. He has enjoyed being the Sports Administrator of the
	Bombay Schools for around 27 years. He also had the great honour of
	being the secretary to the 1<SUP>st</SUP> Bishop of Baroda.
	</P>
	<P>His vision for
	St.Andrews would be for the parishioners to patronize the parish
	school (i.e.St.Andrew's High School) to a larger extent. He would
	also like to democratize the school by having different communities
	in the school.</P>

	<P>He is originally
	from Nalasopara, St.Gonsalo Gracia Parish, Ghas (Vasai). He too
	joined the priesthood at an incredibly young age of 17years in 1962.
	He always longed to be a priest. In fact in Std. 10 he went for a
	retreat and made up his mind thereafter. Fr. Prasad is also very
	talented. He is known for his writing skills. He has released a book
	&quot;Hasan Amhi Hasuya&quot; which contains 1100 jokes and a
	similar book in English with around 600 jokes. Absolutely amazing
	!!! the Bishop too has read his works.</P>
	<P>He has also
	translated the &quot;Legion of Mary&quot; leaflet into Marathi which
	will be released shortly. He also has other talents like acting,
	singing, and music. For him a great achievement was in 1981 at
	Kanjurmarg where 2 more floors of the school needed to be built. To
	raise the funds for the same, a parade called &quot;Tabassum Hit
	Parade&quot; was held at Shamukhananda Hall where the chief guest
	was the famous Mr.Amitabh Bachan. This experience has been an
	unforgettable one. He has also been a parish priest for 16 years in
	various parishes across the city.</P>
	<P>His vision for
	St.Andrew's is mainly directed towards the Marathi speaking
	parishioners for their growth both mentally &amp; spiritually.</P>

	priesthood at a young age of 20 years. He has been in the priesthood
	for an incredibly long 50 years. Some of you may not be aware that
	he had served in our parish years ago from 1978-1981 as Parish
	Priest. It's great to have him back. He has been active with the
	&quot;Alcoholics Anonymous Group&quot;(AA Group). In fact he has had
	some very touching and unforgettable moments and experiences with
	this group which is also special for those who attend. One such
	moment was at a recent meeting held no May 25, 2004 at the A.A.Group
	(Irla) where they have thanked him and mentioned how grateful they
	are. What an unforgettable experience that was !!</P>
	<P>His main aim and
	vision for St.Andrew's is to consolidate the communities and to soon

	<P>Originally from
	Mangalore - Paladka, St.Ignatius Parish. He too joined at a very
	young age. Right after his SSC he joined the SVD Congregation. He
	has been around the country as he studied in Madhya Pradesh and was
	ordained in 1964 in Pune. He worked for 20 years in the &quot;Formation
	House&quot; at Pune, Goa &amp; Mangalore and finally came to Bombay
	in 1987 at St.Theresa's Parish, Bandra. Both his experiences at
	Formation House and Pastoral work have been very different. Pastoral
	work helped to enrich him and he has found great bliss in it. He had
	always wanted to be a priest. Currently he looks after the Konkani
	speaking parishioners.</P>
	<P>His vision is to
	improve family life where he would like to stress on the religious
	as well as social aspect. Since the family is the Basic Unit, this
	is the need of the hour otherwise many families would break up.</P>

	Adrian Phillips</B></U></P>
	<P>He was originally a
	parishioner of St.Theresa's (Girgaum). He was ordained very recently
	on June 9, 2002 and has been in the priesthood for 2 years. He is as
	vibrant and lively as ever. Known for his way with the Youth of our
	parish. He is an absolute people's person. What we don't know is
	that he had other ambitions when young or should I say younger. He
	had wanted to be in the INA (Indian National Army) - Surprised? But
	which ever way he still serves the people if not the country. He has
	also studied Law while in the Seminary. While studying at the
	Seminary he also went to Raigad and stayed &amp; worked in the
	various villages that dot the landscape. He is an 'Action Man'
	always on the move. He not only has a way with people but also has a
	way with words. He knows how to lift you up when you are feeling
	low.</P>
	<P>His vision for the
	parish is that it should take the lead in transforming society.</P>
