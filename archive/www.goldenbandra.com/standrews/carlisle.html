FAVOR WITH CARLISLE</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The stage was set. The
audience restless. The Andrean Fair 1980.. or was it 81? The year
didn&rsquo;t matter. It was one of those mega event ones. The one
that used it&rsquo;s benefactor&rsquo;s generosity to raise money for
something big, like a hospital. Waiting in the wings, about to
perform a solo act for the evening, was this teenage kid eager to
make her tiny mark in the world of entertainment &ndash; Parish level
entertainment &ndash; but entertainment to a large audience
nevertheless &ndash; which to a kid of 17 is hitting the big time
anyway.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&ldquo;Just go get
&lsquo;em&rsquo;girl&rdquo; whispered Carlisle Curry, veteran Master
of Ceremonies to the kid. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give you this big
introduction, and then ask you if you want to be a star. Just say
&lsquo;yes&rsquo;. And then, when I ask you &lsquo;What if someone
tells you you&rsquo;re not star material, just say &lsquo;Then, I&rsquo;ll
make them see stars&rdquo; &ndash; that&rsquo;ll get you a few laughs
and that&rsquo;s a sure way you endear yourself to your audience.
Words of advice from one of Bandra&rsquo;s most loved Emcees.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A week before he is
about to turn 92, I meet him at his home. Around him are cuttings of
articles, copies of books he has written and other assorted faded
memories of days gone by. &ldquo;Tell me about you&rdquo;, I urge
him. We all know that you did a lot for the Salesian Past Pupils
Association, or that you emceed the zonals for a record of time, or
that you made so many couples happy by compering their weddings&hellip;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The once popular voice
is now barely a whisper as he traces his amazing life story &ndash;
with a twist of Oliver. Having lost his mother at the age of 2 years
and 7 months, his father raised him till he was six. Then, as he
recalls, &ldquo;My father took me to an orphanage in Bellary,
Karnataka  run by the Mill fathers and the Hospitaler Sisters. He
left me there and I never saw him again. It was only when I was 10 or
11 that I was informed by the Principal of the Orphanage that he had
received a letter from my step mother, which means that my father had
married again.&rdquo; Just at that time, young Carlisle left the
orphanage to spend a holiday with the Hospitaler sisters in Mount
Mary Convent, Mumbai. Within a week, the sisters received a letter
from the Superior telling the sisters that they should not bring him
back as they had abolished the orphanage. Thus began his tryst with
the place that he now calls home, Bandra.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Till this time,
Carlisle was unaware that he was the offspring of a mixed marriage &ndash;
A Catholic Father and a Protestant mother, and that he was baptized
in a Protestant church in Calcutta. The orphanage in which he was
admitted had no record of this. So he was brought up a Catholic and
continued to live as a Catholic in Bandra till 1924. While in Bandra,
he was inspired by a priest named Msgr Dominic D&rsquo;sa. It was
this priest who together with a fellow priest named Fr Henry Remedios
and Mother Superoior of Mount Mary&rsquo;s who were instrumental in
making him a Roman Catholic. Writes Mr Curry in an article about
himself, &ldquo;I was made a Roman Catholic by a conditional baptism
privately in St Andrew&rsquo;s Church. My godfather was Msgr D&rsquo;Sa
and my Godmother was Our Lady of the Mount. Being a full fledged
catholic, I was God&rsquo;s own child. I shared with friends the joy
and elation of this momentous event and the God given gift which I
considered so meaningful to me&rdquo;.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Another twist of fate
brought him under the wing of  a Salesian priest named Fr Tornquist.
Thus begun his long standing association with the Salesians including
an appointment by the Salesians in Rome to initiate a Don Bosco Past
Pupil&rsquo;s Association in Bombay. As President of the Don Bosco
Past Pupil&rsquo;s Association, he traveled extensively to the
Phillipines, HongKong, Belgium, Spain and of course, Rome which he
proudy informs me, he visited at least seven times.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">All
this wealth of experience  from a self taught and self made person
made Carlisle Curry an institution in his own right in the community
of St Andrew&rsquo;s. He was for fourteen years a member of the
Legion of Mary in addition to being the editor of the &lsquo;Andrean
Notes&rsquo; for almost 42 years besides being the  driving force
behind the zonals for 33 years. His zealous pre-occupation with the
Parish of St Andrew&rsquo;s prompted him to notice what he calls a
&lsquo;phenomenon&rsquo; with regards to the church edifice. Says
Carlisle, &ldquo;After three years of watching as to why the sun
shines in the church, I discovered that ultimately the sun shone on
the arch stone of the arch inside the church, so I felt that I had
discovered a &lsquo;Phenomenon&rsquo; which I thought would occur
each year on the 21<SUP>st</SUP> of March &ndash; the vernal equinox.
Then I saw it again on the 22<SUP>nd</SUP> of September exactly at
7:00 o&rsquo;clock &ndash; of course, my assumption was right &ndash;
it was the Autumnal Equinox.And it can be seen even now on the 21<SUP>st</SUP>
of March and the 22<SUP>nd</SUP> of September.&rdquo;</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">So much for his love
for the Parish of St Andrew&rsquo;s and thankfully the legacy he
leaves behind is still carried on by some of his offspring &ndash;
and their offspring who are still around.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The curtain still
hasn&rsquo;t come down on this nonagerian who continues to endear the
new generation of Curry&rsquo;s be it with his stamp collection of
&rsquo;55,000&rsquo; stamps or stories of days gone by.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">And as for that kid who
stepped out into the stage to claim her moment in the sun at the
Andrean Fair, encouraged by one who had his share of limelight - she
set the stage alight with a fire kindled by one of Bandra&rsquo;s
most cherished compere &ndash; Carlisle Curry.
