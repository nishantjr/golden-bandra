<h3>Health Cell</h3>
<P>The Health Cell was started in January 2001 as a
follow up of the Arch Diocesan Circular asking parishes to form
health cells.</P>
<P>The
Health Cell started functioning with 10 members. Fr. Vincent Pereira
was made the Spiritual Director and Mr. Ashley Nazareth the
Coordinator. &lsquo;</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Presently
the Health Cell has 26 members, 3 of which (Sr. Georgia, Sr. Kusum
and Sr. Nives) are from the Holy Family Hospital.</P>
<P>The
Health cell meeting is held on the second Monday of the month. The
attendance is good; about 12 &ndash;13 members attend regularly. The
Cell has made good progress in spite of its initial ups and downs.
The present Spiritual Director is Fr. Hilary Rodrigues and the
Secretary is Leonie Gomes.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<H4>Aim</H4>
<P>The Vision Statement for
the Health Cell is &ldquo;Networking of the Holistic Health Model&rdquo;
vis a healthy mind leads to a healthy body. The Cell is striving to
achieve its goal, starting from grass root levels to the Parish
level, by conducting talks and Seminars on various health related
topics and focusing on the prevention of diseases, rather than cure
and reaching out to the poor and needy in our Parish.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<H4>Programmes</H4>
<P>Yoga classes were started
in our Parish a year ago. The classes are held in the Bosco Hall
thrice a week after the 6 a.m. mass. There were the usual teething
problems in the beginning but they now have a very good response.
Nearly 20 &ndash; 25 members attend regularly. There is a nominal fee
of Rs. 100/- per month, which is used for maintenance of the room and
other expenses buying equipment. Anita who conducts the classes keeps
the expenses. The Cell also makes available medical appliances like
crutches, walking sticks, wheel chairs, walkers etc. for the use of
any parishioner, especially the needy. A list of items and the names
and phone numbers if the parishioners with whom the items are
available are put up on the Notice Board.</P>
