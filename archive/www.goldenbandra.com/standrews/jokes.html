humorous content from various sources. <br>
We welcome contributions that have an authentic local flavour. <br>
There's a lot of funny stuff going on in our Parish we're sure ... some of which
could actually be humorous, so if you know of any that could be posted on this
page, please send it to us. Equally, if any of our parishioners feels like
contributing sketches or drawings we'd also like that. </b></font></p>
<p><b>These are supposedly ACTUAL announcements from ACTUAL church bulletins.</b></p>
<p>From an old, old, Andrean Notes: We are pleased to announce the birth of David Alan Jesao Fernandes, the sin of Mr and Mrs J.A.P. Fernandes.</p>
<p>Don't let worry kill you - let the church help.</p>
<p>Remember in prayer the many who are sick of our church and community.</p>
<p>This afternoon there will be a meeting in the South and North ends of the church. Children will be baptized at both ends.</p>
<p>Tuesday at 4:00 PM there will be an ice cream social. All ladies giving milk will please come early.</p>
<p>Wednesday the ladies liturgy will meet. Mrs. Pereira will sing "Put me in my little bed" accompanied by the Choir Master.</p>
<p>Thursday at 5:00 PM there will be a meeting of the Little Mothers Club. All ladies wishing to be "Little Mothers" will meet with the Pastor in his study.</p>
<p>This being Easter Sunday, we will ask Mrs. Lewis to come forward and lay an egg on the altar.</p>
