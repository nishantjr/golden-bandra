<BODY>
St Andrew Church is served by a team of dedicated Priests headed by Fr
Vernon Aguiar, our newly appointed Vicar.<br><br>
This section contains information on our priests who so selflessly serve our
needs.
<br>
We plan to post homilies based on the day's Gospel, for each Sunday of the
year. These homilies will be written by different people from and beyond our
Parish.
<br>
The Events link will list routine meetings and special events.
<br>
The Parish history as well as historical details associated with the church,
are also detailed here along with material on St Andrew, our patron saint.
In Profiles we intend to includes details of some of the people who have
served this Parish through the years. It is not possible to have a complete
listing of the numerous people who fall into this category and so we will
endeavour to include as many such personalities as we can get information
on, and will keep updating this page with time.
