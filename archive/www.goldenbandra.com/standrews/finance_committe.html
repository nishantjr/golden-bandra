<h3>Finance Committee</h3>
This began as the 'Ways and Means Committe' founded by Fr Henry Remedios in
June 1950. The responsibilities of this committee are to allocate and
oversee the various expenditures for routine and special projects. The
recent renovation and major repairs conducted on the Bosco Hall building is
an example of the work sanctioned by the Committee.
The Finance committee consists of Joe Pereira, Ms.Charmaine
Barretto, Ernest Fernandes and Henry D\'Souza.Of course
the Head as always is the Parish Priest (Rev. Fr Vernon Aguiar).</BODY></HTML>
