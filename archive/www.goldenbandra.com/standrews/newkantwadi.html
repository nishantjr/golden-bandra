Closing of the Rosary Year and Girl Child Day Celebrations on 26/10/2003

October being the month of the Rosary, St. Peter's community at New
Kantwady recited the Rosary fir th efirst 15 days of the month at
various crosses/grottos located at various buildings/cottages lanes, and
the family members staying near the respective cross/grotto conducted
the Rosary and prepared the petition and prayer of thanksgiving.



The Community celebrated Thanksgiving day on the 5th if October 2003 by
conducting the rosary at the Main Cross and offered up their personal
thanksgiving. After the rosary, light snacks/refreshments were served
and the people mingled together. From the 16th to the 31st of October,
the rosary was said at the Main Cross and it was heartening to see that
most of the time the children conducted the rosary.



Althought the Holy Father had declared 8th September as Girl Child Day,
we could not conduct any function that month due to rains and the Feast
Of Our Lady Of the Mount. Hence, we combined it with the Closing of The
Rosary Year on the 26th of October. this function commenced at around
5:30 pm. A Drawing competition was held for the children, which you
could tell was very much appreciated by the eager looks on their faces.
Each participant was given a packet of sweets and snacks.The competiton
was followed by the rosary, after which the results of the Drawing
competition was announced and prizes were distributed. The prizes were
given away by Mrs. Rosy Fernandes and Mrs. Audrey Miranda.
