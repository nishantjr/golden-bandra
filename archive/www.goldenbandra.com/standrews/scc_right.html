Small Christian Communities (SCC)
Started in 1985 as the Basic Christian Communites, the SCCs today are a
vital parish and community activity. The Parish is sectioned into 23
different groups location wise, each designated by letters of the alphabet.
(See the table below the Map of all SCCs)
This website will post information about ongoing activities in the
individual SCCs.
