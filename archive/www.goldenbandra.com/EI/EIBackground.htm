      the thousands of indigenous, Marathi-speaking people of Mumbai (Bombay)
      and its environs who embraced the Catholic faith, mainly in the period
      1547 to 1600. Though drawn from diverse social groups, they developed a
      ‘consciousness of kind’ over the centuries, chiefly due to the common
      religion that they professed. While the masses remained rooted in the
      rural soil, retaining their Maharashtrian characteristics, the lifestyle
      of the urbanised sections of the community was gradually transformed due
      to Portuguese and English influences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><font size="2">Maharashtra is one of the few states in India that
      has the distinction of having the presence of Christian communities in the
      pre-colonial period. These communities were based at Kalyan, Chaul (Revdanda),
      Sopara (Vasai) and Thane and their presence was acknowledged by Pope John
      XXII in 1329 when he addressed letters to the Christians of ‘Konkan –
      Thana’, and sent them with Bishop Jordan Catalani of Quilon, who had
      been a missionary at Thane, Sopara, etc. from 1321 onwards. Though Elsie
      W. Baptista in her doctoral thesis <i>(‘The East Indians’, 1957)</i>
      links the East Indians with these early Christian communities, we do not
      have, at present, any evidence of their survival.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2">In fact, the foundation of the East Indian community
      was laid in the period 1547 – 1600, when thousands in this area (from
      Dahanu in the north to Chaul in the south) embraced Christianity, chiefly
      due to the missionary enterprise of the Franciscans and the Jesuits.<o:p>

      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><font size="2">The two outstanding missionaries of the early
      period were Fr Antonio do Porto O.F.M. and Bro. Manuel Gomes S.J. who was
      ordained a priest subsequently. Due to the zeal of these two missionaries
      (and many more), village after village received Christianity, and hundreds
      were baptised at solemn ceremonies. The following are examples of four
      places (among many others) at which the baptisms took place:</font></p>

      industry of our friars, they were all converted together and baptised at a
      solemn baptism, more than three hundred souls, and the fervour and
      enthusiasm with which they received the baptismal waters (was so great)
      that each one tried to be the first to receive (baptism) and all who were
      present were not a little astonished and filled with admiration”.<br>

      : “There are now three of us living in this place ... All work well for
      the conversion of souls, so much so that this year two hundred have been
      baptised”. In 1580 over two thousand were baptised at Bandra. This was
      followed by many baptisms in the subsequent years. The annual letter of
      1584 states that practically all the people, except those of the Muslim
      localities, were already Christians. And, we are informed that, in the
      year 1603, “there are no Hindus anywhere in Bandra, all having been
      given the name of Christ”. In 1616 there were over six thousand
      Catholics in Bandra and hence the parish was bifurcated. (Source: History

      whole village of Marol became Catholic. After a very short time thirteen
      other villages under the jurisdiction of Marol followed her example”.
      According to the Jesuit report of 1669 the names of some of the other
      villages are Chakala, Gundowli, Bamanwada, Condita, Saki, etc. From the
      same report we know that there were<br>

      writers give us more details. This is a very early reference about the

      The above are just four examples that illustrate the fruit of the
      Franciscan and Jesuit missionaries. Indeed their zeal, and that of others,
      was so great that by the early decades of the 1600s there were more than
      74,000 Catholics in this region i.e. from Dahanu in the north to Chaul in
      the south. In the following table the figures for Mumbai Island are
      obtained from Paulo da Trindade (I, 36) and the figures for the other

      priest who baptised them or of the sponsor. For example, the Jesuit report
      of 1669 mentions that many converts assumed the name ‘Gomes’ in honour
      of Bro. Manuel Gomes S.J. who evangelised in what is now the Bombay
      Suburban District. Usually all the converts of a particular pakhadi
      (hamlet) assumed the same name, as can be seen from the gravestones and
      the registers of baptisms, marriages and burials in the old churches. It
      must be emphasised that they assumed Portuguese surnames and not
      ‘Christian’ ones as is often understood. (Christians all over the

      layout and houses in an East Indian Village depends on the occupational
      group that lives in it. Accordingly there is a difference between the
      villages of the farmers and the fisherfolk, between those of the growers
      of rice and the growers of vegetables. As elsewhere in this study the
      focus in this section will be on the villages/hamlets of the 'Salsette
      Christians' whose ancestors were the owners of fields, which they
      cultivated. The villages of the Salsette Christians are comprised of
      houses that are built in very close proximity to one another with narrow
      alleys in between. It is interesting to note that the villages of the
      Hindu cultivators in the neighbouring districts also have the same pattern
      – without the wayside crosses.<o:p>

      Why are these houses huddled together when there is so much open land
      around the village? Well, the houses are usually built close to one
      another, often on a rocky or less fertile spot, so as to leave the
      surrounding land free for the cultivation of rice. In contrast those who
      grow vegetables have their individual houses surrounded by 'wadis' or
      gardens. It is precisely on the former rice fields surrounding a village
      that town planning schemes and housing societies have sprung up. Bandra is
      a typical example of this. &nbsp;<o:p>

      West Maharashtra. Specifically, they are the indigenous people of the
      Mumbai Islands, Salsette Island, Vasai and a few other places. This
      habitat, which is characterised by bounty and diversity, has had an
      influence on the economic life, culture and outlook of the community. In
      order to understand and appreciate this, one has to roll back the urban
      sprawl to reveal the rice fields and forests beneath. It is difficult to
      imagine that the slums of Saki Naka cover former farmland, the produce of
      which sustained the Jesuit Mission in East Asia and that the Salsette

      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><font size="2">Water always adds a refreshing touch to a
      landscape besides satisfying personal, agricultural and other needs. The
      East Indian homeland has a great deal of water because of its proximity to
      the sea and the abundant rainfall<br>
      that it receives. In addition to the Vaitarna and Ulhas rivers, there are<br>
      many monsoon streams. Another source of water supply was the numerous
      tanks,<br>
      ponds and wells. Besides, bays, creeks, and inlets are useful for
      transport,<br>
      fishing and the manufacture of salt. The creeks in particular are the
      source<br>
      of the 'black sand' which is used for construction and which comes down
      all<br>
      the way from the ghats. Indeed we take this salt and sand for granted<br>
      without realising that they are peculiar to this region. For example,
      though<br>
      Kerala has a long coastline, the conditions there are not favourable for
      the<br>
      manufacture of salt.</font></p>

      and others usually refer to these as swampy islands. However records
      indicate that they were just as good as any other tropical islands, like
      the neighbouring Elephanta or Salsette for example. The large Salsette
      island had satellite islands like Trombay, Juhu, Dharavi and others. Vasai

      were Chaul (Revdanda), Sopara (Vasai), Kalyan, Thane and Mumbai. Besides<br>

      ridges, especially the ones at Dharavi, provided the Portuguese with stone
      for their churches and forts at Vasai, Goa and other places. Basalt is one
      of nature's many gifts to our great state of Maharashtra. Due to this
      basalt and the diligence and skill of our people, among all the states,
      Maharashtra leads in the number of forts and cave temples. In Salsette
      itself we have caves of great religious significance: Kanheri,
      Mandapeshwar, Mahakali (Kondivita), and a few others. On another island
      are the renowned Elephanta caves. Besides, these ranges were covered with
      dense forests, which were a rich source of timber for the building of the
      churches, forts and other buildings. Boats fashioned from this timber
      sailed for distant shores, and ornate altars and pulpits adorned numerous
      churches.

      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2">Before 1887 the local
      Catholics did not have a fixed or all-embracing designation. Obviously
      they referred to themselves as Catholics and Christians. But they also
      called themselves ‘<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Kunbis</i>’
      (farmers), ‘<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Bhandaris</i>’ (toddy - tappers), ‘<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Kolis</i>’
      (fishermen) etc.<br>
      The Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency, Vol. XIII, Pt I, published in
      1882, has about 19 pages on the native Christians in which it consistently
      calls them ‘<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Thana Christians’</i>
      as Bandra and the rest of Salsette Island was included in Thane District
      till a few decades ago. This gazetteer was published just five years
      before the designation ‘East Indian’ was adopted.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2"><br>
      A large and high-profile section of the community was referred to as the
      ‘Salsette Christians’. Some writers called the community ‘Native
      Bombay Portuguese Christians’ as the elite were educated in Portuguese
      and aped Portuguese ways. Some sections of the community were previously
      referred to as ‘<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Norteiros</i>’
      as they belonged to the Portuguese ‘North Province’ in India.</font></p>

      <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">2. The adoption and significance of
      the designation 'East Indian'<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2">As mentioned earlier,
      the designation ‘East Indian’ was formally adopted by the indigenous
      Christians of the North Konkan, on the occasion of the Golden Jubilee of
      Queen Victoria i.e. in 1887, by the leaders of the Community and the
      ‘Bombay East Indian Association’ was launched on the 26th May of the
      same year Incidentally, it was in the same year, 1887, that the Bori
      Bunder Station was given a new name: Victoria Terminus, which in turn has
      been re-named Chattrapatti Shivaji Terminus.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2"><br>
      It must be emphasised that the leaders of the community consciously and
      deliberately chose the name ‘East Indian’. This is a fact that needs
      to be highlighted and publicised if we are to dispell the mists of
      vagueness, confusion and ignorance that persist about the origin of the
      name. If this fact is not known then the door is left open for simplistic
      and far-fetched theories to enter. A writer has said that the Europeans
      mistook the west coast of India for the east coast. Another has
      erroneously said that the East India Company converted the ancestors of
      the present day East Indians!!</font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify"><br>
      <font size="2">
      But why did they adopt this name? Bombay was the first foot-hold that the
      English acquired in India and the King Charles II handed Bombay over to
      the East India Company to be “the true and absolute Lords and
      Proprietors of the Fort and the Island”. By choosing the designation
      ‘East Indian’, the local Catholic community of Bombay wished to assert
      their rights and privileges as original citizens of Bombay Island and its
      environs in view of the fact that Catholics from Goa and Mangalore who had
      similar surnames were migrating to Bombay, after the introduction of the
      steamships and railways.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2"><br>
      The choice of the name also indicated that the leaders of the community
      wished to express their gratitude and allegiance to the English in
      contrast to some Catholics, indigenous and migrant, who were
      pro-Portuguese. Bombay island was reluctantly surrendered to the
      Portuguese in the years 1661-65 and the Salsette island, Vasai etc. were
      liberated from the Portuguese rule by the Marathas in 1739. However,
      vestiges of the Portuguese presence lingered in Bombay and its environs
      through the presence of the ‘<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Padrado</i>’
      jurisdiction in church affairs. One of the reasons for the anti-Portuguese<br>
      sentiment was that the Portuguese crown and clergy did not give much
      importance to education, commerce etc. in contrast to the English.</font></p>

      Those who chose the name ‘East Indian’ did not find it an incongruous
      designation for an indigenous community of the west coast since,
      technically speaking, any Indian could be called an ‘East Indian’ as
      the world was divided into the ‘West Indies’ and ‘East Indies’,
      with Europe as the point of reference. In fact the West Indian Cricket
      team once referred to our Indian XI as the East Indian team! Did the
      ‘East India Company’ restrict themselves to the east of India? Those
      who express surprise that there ‘East Indians’ on the west coast of
      India indicate that they know their geography but not their history!
      Besides, it would be more confusing if the members of community were
      called ‘West Indians’, as they would be mistaken for natives of the
      Bahamas or some other West Indian Islands in the Atlantic ocean!</font></p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2">Not all the leaders were
      in favour of the designation ‘East Indian’. Notable among those who
      did not approve of it was Kaka Joseph Baptist, the right-hand man of
      Lokamanya Tilak and the first President of the Home Rule League.‘East
      Indian’ was a name that was more suitable to the urbanised sections of
      the community rather than the Marathi-speaking masses who in any case
      hardly used it or identified with it. Even after a hundred years there are
      many who are not even aware of it. For example in Vasai there are tens of
      thousands of native Catholics who are ‘East Indians’ but they reserve
      this name for those who inhabit two or three villages or hamlets! Even the
      Catholic <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Kolis</i> hardly refer to
      themselves as ‘East Indians’. And strangely, some non-East Indians
      identity the word 'East Indian' with the Vasai Catholics and the Kolis
      exclusively.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2"><br>
      The name is not an exclusive one, for it is also used by some in West
      Bengal who are in no way connected with those in and around Bombay bearing
      the same name. Besides, the name was formerly used by those who are called
      Eurasians today. The name is an inappropriate and misleading one, for few
      would be expected to be aware that it has a historical and not
      geographical connotation. Whereas the native Catholics of Kerala and Goa
      are called Keralites (Malayalees) and Goans respectively, a large section
      of the original Catholics of Maharashtra are not called Maharashtrians but
      East Indians! It<br>
      appears that the designation ‘Maharashtrian’ has been monopolised by
      the Hindus! Ironically, some Hindu Maharashtrians who have recently
      migrated to Mumbai from distant districts of the State imagine that the
      East Indians are outsiders in ‘amche Mumbai’.</font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2"><br>
      However, there are some who are aware that the East Indians are truly
      'sons of the soil'. One of these migrants to Mumbai, Bal Thackeray, wrote
      as follows in 1968: &quot;The East Indians, who are essentially
      Maharastrians, have also suffered. Being sons of the soil they find
      themselves strangers in their own land. Their ancestral lands are
      acquired, their houses have been demolished; for want of money their
      children cannot get higher education, and for want of higher education,
      they cannot get better jobs.&quot; (Page 5, 'The Bombay East Indian', 15
      January 1968). Because of this inappropriate name, some East Indians are
      at a loss when people ask “What are you?” or “Where are you
      from?”. For the answer will elicit more questions than he or she would
      be able to answer.</font></p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2">While Catholics from
      other states in India identity with their respective States and even in
      Mumbai speak nostalgically of their ‘native place’. East Indians, by
      and large, are not enthusiastic about their state although it is a
      prosperous and progressive one. On the other hand it must be admitted that
      the name ‘East Indian’ has given the urbanised sections and some
      others a sense of identity and served as a cohesive element.</font></p>

      </span>A change of designation?<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2">Elsie W. Baptista, in
      her doctoral thesis on the community, states : “The name ‘East
      Indian’ is a misnomer. In 1887 there were, no doubt, certain
      circumstances that compelled the leading lights of the community to adopt
      the name ‘East Indian’. Those circumstances are now no more in
      existence. The East India Company has gone forever. The British Raj has
      pulled out of the Indian soil gracefully. India today is a sovereign
      state. Among the diverse people of this land, ‘East Indian’ appears to
      be an odd element with a foreign flavour. The homeland of the East Indians
      is situated in Maharashtra. Their language is Marathi. A good deal of
      their culture, especially of the ruralites, is Maharashtrian. Is it not in
      the fitness of things and in accord with the community’s historical and
      cultural background for the East Indians to adopt the designation
      Maharashtrian Christians?”</font></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2"><br>
      Elsie Baptista made this proposal before the State of Maharashtra was
      formed. While the State was being formed this suggestion was revived by
      many in the community. However it was not considered seriously. While the
      designation Maharashtrian Christian, would not be an exclusive one, as it
      would also include the indigenous Christians of Ahmednagar, Nagpur etc, it
      would have many advantages. A suggestion has also been made that the
      members of the community should be called Mumbaikars, as a substantial
      percentage of them hail from Greater Mumbai. Even those who are originally
      from adjacent areas could be called Mumbaikars, just as those who are
      originally from places which are at a great distance from Mangalore, are
      called Mangaloreans.</font></p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:justify"><font size="2">As this paper has been
      mainly concerned with the rediscovery of the roots of the community, it
      has not focused many interesting topics, e.g. community traditions,
      customs, cuisine, forklore, folk-songs, the development of the community,
      urban occupations and professions, and contemporary challenges, etc..<br>
      However it is hoped that some of those participating in this seminar will<br>
      read about these aspects in order to understand and appreciate this<br>
      community, which is unique, in as much as it owes its origin to a change
      of<br>
      religion. Besides, it is the only large Christian community in India which
      is<br>
      indigeneous to a metropolis.</font></p>
