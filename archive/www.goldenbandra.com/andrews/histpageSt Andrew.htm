      December, 1575, a Jesuit says that there are three of them in Bandra and
      that 200 persons had been baptized in that year. In 1580, over 2000 were
      baptized and in 1616 there were 6000 Catholics in Bandra - nearly the
      entire population.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2"><font size="2">The new Christians assumed the surname of
      the Priest who baptized them or of the sponsor. Other aspects of their
      life did not change, e.g. they continued to speak their dialect of
      Marathi, carried on with their traditional occupations, dress, diet, etc.
      The reports of those days extol the faith of the Christians of Bandra.</font></p>

      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2"><font size="2">Between 1577 and 1583, the Jesuits built
      a residence by the creek with a Chapel attached, which served as a parish
      Church. However, it was not a parish Church in the strict sense of the
      term, as the Jesuit Catalogue for this year states that Fr. Manoel Gomes
      S.J. was ‘in charge’. A few years later, (certainly by the year 1590),
      it became a parish Church, for we are informed that Fr. Gomes is its
      Vicar.</font></p>

      to the Jesuit residence which was situated south of where the present BEST

      the Jesuit report of 1669. It says, &quot;in the island of Salsette, there
      is a church under the invocation of St. Anne. The village is in the lowest
      (the southern most) path of the island at the point nearest to the island
      of Mahim. This church is very old and is one of the most beautiful in
      these parts; it is also very big, although the faithful became so
      numerous, that the Fathers of the Society had to build another church
      under the invocation of St. Andrew near the sea. Notwithstanding this, the
      parish of St. Anne had 3000 faithful. On the church of St. Anne, depended
      the hermitage of Our Lady of the Mount. The feast is celebrated each year
      on the 8</font></font><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">th</font><font FACE="Verdana"><font size="2">
      of September, the feast of the Nativity of Our Lady. The Parish Priest of

      Mother&quot;.</font></p>

      English engineers on 25</font></font><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">th</font><font FACE="Verdana"><font size="2">
      March, 1739. What was the reason for this? During the Maratha-Portuguese
      war (1737-1739) the English feared that if the Marathas captured Bandra
      they would have a strategic location along side the creek and on the hill
      at Bandra. From these places they could fire at the English who were at
      the Mahim side of the creek. Their position would be stronger if they
      captured St. Anne Church for it was with a fortification equipped with
      guns. Therefore, the English were of the opinion that it should be
      destroyed and insisted on it being done before they helped the Portuguese
      against the Marathas.</font></p>

      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2"><font size="2">Centuries ago the present St. Andrew
      Church was a hermitage. We do not know the year of its foundation but we
      know that it existed in 1601, for in that year, Pope Clement VIII,
      &quot;granted an indulgence of 20 years and 40 days to the faithful who,
      after going to confession and receiving Holy Communion, would visit on
      Maundy Thursday, from the rising of the sun to its setting on the
      following day, the hermitages of Mount Mary’s and St. Andrew’s&quot;.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2"><font size="2">In the year 1616, as the Church of St.
      Anne had 6000 parishioners, a new parish was formed, that of St. Andrew.
      Perhaps, it was at this time that a church replaced the hermitage.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2"><font size="2">In 1739, when St. Anne Church was
      destroyed, St. Andrew Church was the only Church in Bandra and the parish
      comprised of the entire Bandra and the adjacent areas. During the Maratha
      period (1739-1775) St. Andrew Church continued to function as usual. In
      fact, it was the venue of the ordination of a Bishop - the earliest in
      Bombay as far as the records go.</font></p>

      on a brick base paved with marble and which extends almost to the
      roof&quot;. The present altar has three niches - the Sacred Heart and our

      historical significance as well, since it is also the original one of the

      sepals that turn outward and are held together by angels. On each petal is
      a carving representing the prophets of the Old Testament. Above hangs a
      canopy with the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove carved on it. Old
      parishioners remember the stone steps leading to the pulpit from the
      outside which were demolished and walled in when the church was being
      extended and steps built from the inside of the church, necessitating the
      removal of two of the beautifully carved panels. (See '<a href="pictpage.htm">Pictorials</a>'

      Mary Immaculate are also of sixteenth century origin. The Resurrection
      scene shows Christ trampling over death represented by a skeleton that is
      wasted and rotted, thus showing the triumph of Christ’s redemption of
      mankind over death and sin. The Assumption of Our Lady into heaven is
      depicted by a crown held over head by the hands of God, the Father and God
      the Son, while the Holy Spirit hovers above. It is interesting to note
      that the representation of the Assumption of Our Lady was already part of
      religious art even before the dogma of the Assumption became the <i>Magisterium</i>
      of the church. (See '<a href="pictpage.htm">Pictorials</a>' for a visual

      stained glass windows were built with the new façade when the church was
      extended. The base of the north tower now accommodates the stairway to the
      choir. The base o the other two houses the Baptistery whose stained glass
      window has been recently restored. The bells that was first kept in the
      window facing east is the oldest. It bears the inscription &quot;SANTRO
      ANDRE DE BANDORA, 1793&quot; around the outside of the rim and on the body
      is a cross in an oval. It was used to announce deaths, arrival of funerals
      at the church and on All Souls Day. The bell that was kept in the window
      facing north has the inscription partly in Portuguese and partly in
      English : SANTO DE ANDRE BANDORA, 1869. RECAST 1900&quot;. This was used
      for the Angelus and to summon the faithful to service and on festive
      occasions. The largest bell in the center of the belfry is of more recent
      origin, being presented in 1934 by Sir Dominic Joseph Ferreira, K.C.S.S.
      in memory of his wife Josephine. It was cast by Gossen Von Humpert, Brilon,
      and was used daily at 8.30 p.m. &quot;to remind the faithful to pray for
      the departed souls, for the Angelus, and on festive occasions&quot;. All
      three bells are now in the new north tower.</font></p>

      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2"><font size="2">One of the ‘side altars’ of St.
      Andrew Church, Bandra, has a niche with a large wooden statue of Mary
      carrying the Child Jesus. This statue is not particularly graceful or
      artistic but it is of historical value.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2"><font size="2">The Annual Jesuit letter of the year 1669
      tells us that it is an image of ‘Our Lady of the Navigators’ .
      Initially one may be surprised at this title for the statue does not have
      any symbol of or association with ‘navigation’.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2"><font size="2">However, the Jesuit letter explicitly
      states the fishermen found a statue in the sea, off the Bandra coast.
      Perhaps, this statue was enshrined in a Portuguese ship and fell into the
      sea during a storm or shipwreck.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2"><font size="2">This is the only statue that was found in
      the sea according to records presently available. It is likely, according
      to a writer, that this fact has been transferred to the statue of Our Lady
      of the Mount.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2"><font size="2">The statue of Our Lady of Navigators on
      the side altar of St. Andrew Church, Bandra had a silver crown, which was
      stolen a few decades ago. This crown had an inscription, which was quite
      intriguing. It read &quot;In the <i>Samvat</i> year 1816 on the 8</font></font><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">th</font><font FACE="Verdana"><font size="2">
      day of the waning moon (after full moon) in the month of <i>Shravan</i>
      (August-September) two silver crowns were made for Nossa Senhora do Monte
      and the child by Dharma Patel, Thalkai, Koli, Naratha, in fulfillment of a
      promise made through Vaghset. D. 1760&quot; (please note that 1816
      according to the <i>Samva</i>t year is approximately equivalent to 1760 of
      the Christian era.)</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2"><font size="2">Although this crown was presented for use
      on the statue of Our Lady of Navigators, and made keeping that size in
      mind, yet the inscription says that it was made for the statue of Our Lady
      of the Mount (which would need a smaller crown). Did the donor make a
      mistake? Was Our Lady of Navigators also referred to as Our Lady of the
      Mount? No satisfactory explanation has been offered for this.</font></p>

      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2"><font size="2">The idea of consecrating Bandra to Christ
      the King was initiated by the Very Rev. Fr. Dominic de Sa (Parish Priest,
      St. Andrew Church) who received the fullest co-operation from the Vicar of
      St. Peter’s Church, Fr. Cassassayas, S.J. and Fr. John Gomes, Vicar of
      Mount Carmel’s Church. Preparations for the occasion were started months
      ahead with the formation of an Organising Committee. On the evening before
      the great day an Academy on the Kingship of Christ presided over by H.E.
      The Delegate Apostolic, the Most Rev. Dr. Leo R. Kierkels, C.P. was held
      in St. Peter’s Church compound. The Archbishop of Bombay, the Most Rev.
      Dr. Joaquim R. Lima, S.J. and the Prefect Apostolic of Kashmir, Msgr.
      Joseph Donohoe also graced the occasion.</font></p>

      February, 1935, the Delegate Apostolic sang the Pontifical High Mass in
      St. Andrew Church, after which the Blessed Sacrament was exposed for
      continuous adoration. The evening service was one of unparalleled
      splendour and magnificence with about 20,000 people participating. After
      the sermon by Rev. Dr. L. Raymond the Blessed Sacrament was borne in
      procession along Hill Road southward to Supali (Supari) Tank for
      Benediction. The procession continued along Chapel Road, St. Peter’s
      Road and Hall Road, back to St. Andrew’s. The Delegate Apostolic gave
      the sermon on Christ the King; then the Act of Consecration was read by
      Ref. Fr. D. de Sa. After Benediction the crowds were regaled to a display
      of fireworks. The monument to commemorate this event was designed by Mrs.
      Lourdes Netto and the pedestal by Mr. Robert Athogias. A special hymn to
      &quot;Christ the King&quot; was composed by Mr. Sally Athogias.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2"><font size="2">The Silver Jubilee of this event was
      celebrated on 7</font></font><font FACE="Verdana" SIZE="2">th</font><font FACE="Verdana"><font size="2">
      February 1960. Fifty motorcyclists and scooters from Bandra escorted His
      Eminence Valerian Cardinal Gracias, from Mahim Causeway to St. Andrew
      Church where His Eminence was received by the parish Priest, Papal Knights
      and papal Medallists who led the procession into the Church while the
      choir sang &quot;Ecce Sacrdos Magnus&quot;. After Pontifical Mass sung by
      His Eminence, the Blessed Sacrament was exposed for adoration the whole
      day. The evening ceremony was yet another memorable occasion. The
      procession with the Blessed Sacrament on a decorated float led to St.
      Peter’s Church compound for Benediction, then along Chapel Road to Mount
      Carmel’s Church compound and back to St. Andrew’s along Mount Carmel
      Road and Hill Road. After the sermon by His Eminence, Msgr. Henry Remedios
      read the Act of Consecration. Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament brought
      the ceremony to a close.</font></p>
