<p class="Head1"><b><font FACE="NuptialScript" SIZE="6" COLOR="#046693">Dear
Parishioners</font><font FACE="NuptialScript" SIZE="6" COLOR="#000000"></p>
</font></b><font SIZE="3"><b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">Right on the day</b> when the Andrean Notes
will come to you, our parish will be celebrating &quot;Adoration Day&quot;. In
earlier days it used to be called the &quot;XIII Hours Adoration&quot;. It is
now called, just plain &quot;Adoration Day&quot; for the simple reason that the
Blessed Sacrament is no more exposed for 13 hours as before (for reasons
liturgical) but only after the last Mass in the morning until the last
Benediction in the evening, which works up to about eight hours.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">You may ask, &quot;what is this ‘Adoration
Day’ all about? Well, the purpose of ‘Adoration Day’ is to give <b>due</b>
honour to Jesus Christ in the Eucharist. Although Jesus is truly present in the
Blessed Sacrament and is worthy of our love, honour and attention, yet we are
unable to give Him the honour that is <b>due</b> to Him. So, one day in a year,
the whole parish, as one community, tries to give the Eucharistic Christ the
honour and reverence that are <b>due</b> to Him. This is done in three specific
ways, thus :</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">1. Since Jesus has given Himself as a love gift
to us in the Eucharist every parishioner is expected to make it a point to
celebrate the Eucharist fully and receive Holy Communion on Adoration Day.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">2. After sharing Himself as &quot;Bread of
Life&quot; in the Eucharist, Jesus stays with us in the Blessed Sacrament of the
Altar, as He desires to be with us &quot;till the end of time&quot;. His
continual presence with us calls for a response from us to spend time with Him,
praising, thanking, adoring and loving Him and praying for our needs. But we
cannot always do this because we have to work and do our other duties - and He
wants us to do that too! So, one day in a year, we parishioners, <b>as one body</b>,
acknowledge His presence and show our gratitude to Him by paying Him a visit in
the Blessed Sacrament. Here again, as we cannot be with Him the whole day (some
do!) we do it in turns (with our Small Christian Communities) so that the whole
parish, <b>as a body</b> does Him the honour that is <b>due</b> to Him.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">3. We culminate this Adoration Day with a
public demonstration showing that we believe that Jesus is truly present in the
Blessed Sacrament and that He deserves to be honoured not only privately but
also publicly as Lord and King. Hence, the procession through the streets of the
parish. This procession is a public demonstration of the <b>whole parish</b> of
our faith in the true Presence of Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament and that He is
our Lord and King. Hence, the grand decorations of the streets and the altars.
This also calls for a devotional and prayerful procession. Any talking or joking
while in the procession would be a counter-sign!</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">It follows from this that the <b>whole parish</b>
should take part in the above mentioned triple honour to the Eucharistic Lord
and particularly in the concluding service in the evening which consists of
Benediction in the Church, the renewal of the consecration of Bandra and our
parish to Christ the King, the procession and the final Benediction.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">My observation is that not everybody takes part
in the Concluding Service. Probably it is because not everybody understands the
real meaning of Adoration Day and the purpose of the Grand Concluding Service. I
hope with the above explanation, all our parishioners will understand its
meaning and respond with a devotion that is befitting the occasion.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">Given the solemnity of the day, it is befitting
that this should be reflected in the home during the day. Parishioners should
therefore refrain from taking up any social or sports engagements on Adoration
Day. They should also refrain from fixing marriages or baptisms or any other
celebration on Adoration Day and give the whole day to the Lord.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">Another question that could be asked is:
&quot;why is Adoration Day held in February?&quot; The reason is because the
whole of Bandra (together with our parish) was consecrated to Christ the King on
3</font><font SIZE="1">rd</font><font SIZE="3"> February, 1935 in our church
compound before the statue of Christ the King that stands in front of the
church. Hence, the Sunday following the 3</font><font SIZE="1">rd</font><font SIZE="3">
of February is always observed as Adoration Day. If the whole of Bandra cannot
gather together (as it did in 1935) then let the whole of the parish of St.
Andrew gather together to give <b>due</b> honour to our Lord Jesus Christ on
every Adoration Day.</p>

</b>in the Novena Mass in preparation for St. Andrew’s Feast on Saturday,
November 25, 2000 at 7.15 p.m. Fr. Anthony D’Souza celebrated the Eucharist.
The theme for our Mass was <i>‘We are a Church that is one in faith and
worship’.</i> The families of our communities were requested to bring food
items as offerings and the response was overwhelming. Later, our band of SVP
members distributed these offerings to the poor families of our Parish.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">Also, this year, the <i>Andrean Mela</i> on St.
Andrew’s grounds on Sunday, December 3, was wholly organised by the SCCs for
the first time. Each community was asked to prepare different types of snacks.
We prepared assorted sandwiches. It was an excellent opportunity for the core
groups and others of our zone to work as a team for a common goal. There was
fellowship and each one put in his/her best efforts to make the feast day a
success. Thank you one and all.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">&quot;<b>To Err is human</b> but to forgive is
divine&quot;</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">A very obvious shift in the church’s
perception of the role of the laity was evident in the celebration of the feast
of St. Andrew, heralded by a nine-day novena. The SCC laity of community X,Y and
Z used their creativity and talent to prepare the liturgy for one day of the
novena on December1st. The theme was &quot;Forgiveness&quot;.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">&quot;To err is human but to forgive is
divine&quot; was lucidly brought out in a little skit, which was enacted instead
of the homily. A person may feel tormented (twin roles played by Winnie Lobo and
Maria D’Souza) without realizing that emotions of anger, bitterness, jealousy,
hatred, frustration etc., have been activated by the devil and his imp (roles
played by Mildred Pereira and Bernard Reis) to the disappointment of the
Guardian Angel (Manuella Reis).</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">Negative thoughts give rise to pessimistic
attitudes resulting in an outburst of physical symptoms such as hypertension,
diabetes, heart condition, etc. which we often relate to diagnostic causes
rather than to an abrasion in our spiritual life.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">A few SCC members (Lucy, Rose, Lynnette,
Rosalind and Cecilia) were able to delve into the deep-rooted cause of the
problem, in this case, resentment for a family member over a property dispute.
An admission of this fact, not without a deep psychological struggle,
emancipated the tormented person to a realization that God is the greatest
healer, if only we trust in Him fully and we forgive, love and pray for the
person who has hurt us. The tormented person then unwound herself and started
feeling lighter and better.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">Book marks with the picture and prayer of St.
Francis of Assisi, were distributed to all the faithful at the beginning of the
mass and these were raised at the offertory, the Celebrant, Fr. Vincent Pereira,
Director of the Community, inviting the people to recognize any negative
thoughts or feelings they had and to surrender them to the Lord.</p>

</font><font SIZE="3">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">In mid-November</font></b><font SIZE="3"> a
meeting of representatives of SCCs was called for to chalk out a programme for
the Andrean Mela to be held on December 03, 2000 on the St. Andrew’s Grounds.
Fr. Terence was the main co-ordinator. Innovative ideas were called for which
would mean involving communities to fulfil the theme ‘<i>Communion of
Communities’.</p>
</i>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">At the first meeting, which was well
represented, a general programme was debated upon which would include games,
food, entertainment and sundry sales. Emphasis was laid on designing a ‘democratic
Mela’ i..e primarily for the people, by the people and of the people of St.
Andrew’s Parish. This led to a serious debate of entry passes being restricted
to Andreans only, which was dismissed at the next meeting, as it didn’t seem
practical. The second meeting emerged with constructive ideas and unanimous
decisions by representatives of communities. Committees were formed to
co-ordinate the various tasks in putting up such a show. Each community was
requested to provide 100 plates of snacks and with all the snacks snapped up by
the end of that evening, the variety of fare was well appreciated and indeed
enjoyed by all. Two communities ventured into taking charge of the soft drinks
stall and they were certainly not disappointed. Assured sales of snacks were
taken care of by way of pre-sales of coupons for snacks &amp; soft drinks
amongst the communities. Table sales took care of some of the overheads and also
a diversion for the ‘compulsive shopper’. A fair profit has resulted in
reaching out towards the dire needs of the Andrean Social Service Evening School
for the underprivileged being run by a dedicated few in our Parish School at St.
Andrew’s.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">The evening began with tele-games conducted by
the Andrean Youth with participation at community level followed by games at
various stalls. A variety of stage programmes throughout the evening involving
all age groups kept the crowds glued to the stage. No one can dispute the fact
that the Andrean Youth kept the Andreans on their toes all evening without a
dull moment. Considering the short notice and few hands that put up this event
and seeing the large numbers on the grounds that evening, it would be fitting to
conclude that the Mela was indeed a huge success and the Andrean Family looks
forward to another such delightful evening.</p>

After a multitude of yes’s, he said his final YES when God called him on that

arduous for him, be it the community or anybody else. He was a familiar cheery

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">The triumph of good over evil</font></b><font SIZE="3">
was so beautifully related to us when at the Community Mass of New Kantwadi held
on January 9th, Fr. Rufus Pereira, the healing preacher and a former resident of
this peaceful village, calmed our apprehensions about the evil doings of Satan
and his henchmen.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">Jealousy and hatred towards our neighbours were
the principal cause of many of our problems. Fr. Rufus highlighted the power of
forgiveness without which our prayers and offerings were meaningless. Petitions,
written on slips of paper and put forward by the large congregation were burnt
during the Mass as an offering. Each of us were given the power to suppress evil
doings in the form of blessed salt and water which we were told to sprinkle into
every room of our homes and also to be used as a counter measure to any evil
cast upon us. The Mass was followed by individual blessings from Fr. Rufus. The
‘mysterious box’ that Fr. Rufus carried along contained a piano accordion.
He accompanied us to a lively sing-song of hymns enjoyed by everyone.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">It was encouraging to see the youth of our

greatest enthusiasm of enjoying themselves. Santa drove the crowds round the
village accompanied by the eldest and the youngest of the village. Games for all
age groups and spot prizes kept the crowds entertained all evening. After a
sumptuous dinner, Santa saving the best for the last, distributed gifts to the
eager little kiddies. This is a party that will be remembered for a long, long

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2"><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial Narrow Bold">Bitterness
can cripple you&nbsp;</font></p>
<font SIZE="3">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">Do you wish </font></b><font SIZE="3">to enjoy
an unfettered life - a life unshackled in your attitude towards people? Sure,
you’d want to. For to function effectively and to enjoy living, you have to be
unchained emotionally to the many resentments that flesh is heir to.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">Perhaps you have been cheated of your share of
the family property while you were away. You’re enraged and cannot get over
it. A loved one is snatched away by sudden death! ‘God! How could you have
done that to me?’ you cry out in bitter anguish. Hurts like these can arouse
anger. Such emotions cause resentments. Brooded on, they lead to bitterness.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">Life is beset with occasions in plenty to
generate resentment against people. But being resentful fetters one’s
activity. We wake up unrefreshed because we turned over in bed the night before
grappling with our resentments. We bruise ourselves while shaving because we
allow resentful thoughts to plague us. We endanger our safety while driving
being unable to concentrate on the road. And at work, our emotional energy is
drained away. We are ineffective in all we do.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">Is there a way to handle such emotions? The
story of Joseph in Genesis, Ch. 39 onwards, shows the way: even though his
brothers threw him into a pit and sold him away, Joseph held no grievance
against them. Even though Potipher’s wife accused him after vainly trying to
seduce him, Joseph bore no grudge against her and did not report her to her
husband. Joseph had interpreted the cupbearer’s dream and the latter was freed
from prison as predicted. But he forgot to inform Pharaoh about Joseph who was
languishing in prison. So Joseph remained another two years in jail. Yet, Joseph
did not harbour any resentment against him. Joseph forgave them all.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">While resentment and bitterness enter uninvited
into our lives, God has made a way to handle these emotions effectively. ‘Forgive!’
says the Bible. Not once, not twice, but seventy times seven! It may not be
possible to do this on your own. You need divine help to be able to forgive. ‘Ask
and it will be given you …… For everyone who asks receives’.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">After their father Jacob died, the brothers
were afraid of what might befall them at the hands of Joseph. They felt secure
while their father was alive. But now they began to fear for their lives. They
went up to their brother, Joseph, to seek his forgiveness. Joseph said to them:
‘As for you, you meant evil against me; but God meant it for good’. Joseph,
now governor of Egypt spoke reassuringly to his brothers: ‘Do not fear; I will
provide for you and your little ones’.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">‘Get rid of bitterness,’ exhorts the
Apostle Paul in his letter to the Ephesian Church. Harbouring resentment and
bitterness only cripples our lives and smothers the joy of living. Amy
Carmichael, an Irish missionary, once said, ‘Nothing anyone can do to us can
injure us unless we allow it to cause a wrong reaction in our spirits’.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">We can learn to handle a wrong reaction by
first learning to forgive.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">To get our parishioners into the true spirit of
Christmas, St. Andrew’s Church organizes its usual Community Crib Competition
in December 2000. The theme ‘<i>Christ Yesterday, Today &amp; Forever’.</p>
</i>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">Our Community ‘H’, St. Teresa of Avila
which includes the buildings and cottages between Archlyn and Mello Ville on
both sides of St. Paul Road [S], set about preparing its crib with great
enthusiasm. Fleta and Belinda Remedios were the main members who designed, drew
and painted the enormous backdrop and figures of St. Joseph &amp; Our Blessed
Virgin Mary with Baby Jesus. Core group members Freeda, Margaret and Ivan set up
the crib in the compound of ‘Phoenix’ with the help of some community
members.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">The weather too decided to test the community’s
interest in the crib competition. The strong winds and rain kept Freeda busy in
maintaining the crib for the ‘D’ Day - December 28, when the cribs would be
judged. We are proud and mighty pleased to state that our crib won the 2</font><font SIZE="1">nd</font><font SIZE="3">
place. <i>CONGRATS!!</i> Core group &amp; Community members who tirelessly
helped in achieving this success. God Bless You.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">Third Prize</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">Holy Angels Community</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">Each aspect of the theme &quot;Christ
Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow&quot; was well depicted. ‘Christ Yesterday’
was depicted as baby Jesus in the crib at Bethlehem. ‘Christ Today’ was
depicted with photographs of youth pasted on Stars and hung on a Christmas Tree.
‘Christ Tomorrow’ was depicted with a group photograph of our Community
members pasted on a large picture of the Sun with the words &quot;Christ forever
in the Holy Angels Community. Truly a community effort !</p>

</font><font SIZE="3">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">It all started</font></b><font SIZE="3"> when
Nicole our area representative informed us about the Crib Competition happening
in our Parish…we literally summoned kids from around who were enthusiastic to
help us. As we progressed in our efforts we were encouraged by people from our
area with material, advise and occasionally even a li’l nibble! Finally on the
eve of Christmas sometime before we left for midnight Mass, we accomplished what
we set out to do – frantically working towards completing our crib so that we
could receive Christ on that very night in our little home we built for him.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">Working on a shoe string budget, we used a
mango crate picked up from the street for a crib, someone brought wire to hang
it up from the support, paints and thermocol somehow just fell into our hands
and our considerate neighbours provided the light connections. Much to our
amazement, our crib received a special prize, which we owe to the genuine
enthusiasm and intitiative of the members of our Community. In the process not
only did we do something for Christmas but we also learnt much about each other
and the people we live with!</p>

</font><b><font SIZE="3">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="Body2">December 17, 2000</font></b><font SIZE="3"> was
a red-letter day for the Senior Citizens of our Parish. It began with 9.30 a.m.
Mass with appropriate offertory gifts and prayers of the faithful specially
dedicated to the Senior Citizens. Soon after the Service, a Senior Citizens
Choir entertained their fellow folk with Carols who spontaneously joined in. The
rest of the morning was spent at the Bosco Hall with fun and games where Santa
delighted everyone distributing sweets and goodies to all. Sumptuous snacks and
coffee was served. Nestle’s and the Organizers’ contributions took care of
the prizes and some of the gifts. As each Senior Citizen brought along a gift
and put it in a box, everyone could take home a ‘surprise gift’. The morning
whizzed past but well spent and soon it was time to make our way home, but we
look forward to more such occasions with suggestions, sponsors and donors.</p>
