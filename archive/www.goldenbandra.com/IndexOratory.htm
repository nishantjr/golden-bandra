      <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">‘The’ Oratory at Ranwar is a familiar landmark to
      residents and passers-by alike. As far as all the present residents of
      the Village are concerned, the Oratory has always been there. (That
      statement just about could shave through, by a couple of years, as ‘Aunty’
      Flavy Pereira, who’s house, ‘The Trellis’ adjoins the Oratory, will
      celebrate her 97th birth day on the same day that the Oratory celebrates
      its 100th year.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">To mark this special landmark the residents, past and
      present, of Ranwar Village, along with friends, plan to organise several
      events through the year, culminating on the <b>26th December 2006, in a
      solemn Mass at the Oratory and a get together and dinner at the Rest
      Ranwar grounds.

      centenary year, on <b>December 26, 2005</b>.<br>
      As has happened, literally on thousands of evenings in the last century,<br>
      we plan to have a Rosary at the Oratory followed by the mandatory, ‘boiled
      gram’<br>
      (could we have a Village Rosary without boiled gram ?) and other light
      refreshments.</font><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2"><br>

 This Mass will be ‘hosted’
      by all the present Priests from Ranwar&nbsp;<br>
 and we will invite other priests
      and bishops to the Mass.</font></p>
      <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Trebuchet MS" size="2">We invite Ranwarites, in Ranwar, and all the many parts
