      <h2>Registry Records</h2>
      <p><font size="2">The Church registry records in St Andrew date back to
      the late 1600's. The earliest&nbsp; register available is actually the
      last register used at the Church of Santa Anna. This was transferred to St
      Andrew's when St Anne's was blown up in 1739.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">The early records are in Portuguese painstakingly entered in
      calligraphic script on paper that today is crumbling. In the last decade
      concerned volunteers have initiated an ongoing project to have the records
      translated and transferred onto disk in order to preserve the information
      contained in the Church records. There are also plans to photograph each
      individual page of the earliest records before they deteriorate further.
      </font> 
      <h3>Details regarding the first register preserved in the Church</h3>
      <p>T<font size="2">his register (Volume 1) pertains to Portuguese Bandra and was originally at the
      church of Santa Anna. The baptisms commence from December 1715 and end in
      March 1737 when the church of Santa Anna was closed, in July 1737
      following the Maratha invasion of Salsette (April1737) and the ensuing
      seige of Bandra. A British garrison of around 50 men occupied the Jesuit
      residence at that time. Baptisms after July 1737 were performed at the
      Church of St Andrew which remained the only functioning parish church in
      Bandra. It appears that this first register was brought to St Andrew's
      following the closure of Santa Anna.The baptismal register gives the dates
      of baptism but not the birth date. The vicars are all Jesuits. Some
      secular priests are mentioned in the register- termed 'clerigo', they
      lived in private houses and functioned as directed by the vicar.
      Professions are frequently mentioned. All entries are signed by the vicar
      or by the baptising priest. Secular priests based in Mahim (British
      territory) are occasionally mentioned as baptising.</font><h3>Baptismal Registers&nbsp;of St Andrew</h3>
      <p><font size="2">No corresponding register of St Andrew's of the Portuguese days exists.
      Volume 2 records&nbsp; baptisms performed between 1st June 1749 and end
      1756. It contains baprism performed in one unified parish. The latter part
      of this volume contains affadivits of baptisms performed between 1738 and
      1756. This is a result of the original baptism entries being lost. </font>
      <p><font size="2">Volume 3 is a baptism register with entries from 1778 to 1799. This
      register covers the British period in Bandra (the British occupied Bandra
      in the second half of December 1774). All priests mentioned in the
      registers 2 and 3 are native secular priests. </font>
      <p><font size="2">The fourth volume of baptismal entires has numbered baptisms. It
      commences from 1800. It is clear from the numbering that leaves containing
      entries are missing for the years 1800 and 1801. </font>
      <p><font size="2">For the year 1884 no baptismal enties are found after August 11 till
      the end of the year. </font> 
      <p><font size="2">The baptismal entires have been written in Portuguese. This is the case
      till 1915. Thereafter the entires are in English. </font>
      <h3>Marriages</h3>
      <p><font size="2">Marriages commence with the year 1750 starting with affadivits. The
      first three volumes are chronologically in great disorder. Broadly, they
      cover the period from 1750 till May 1802. </font>
      <p><font size="2">The fourth volume commences July 28 1805 and ends on 15 August 1829.
      Hence it is clear that mariage entries for the period 1802 (9 May) till 28
      July 1805 are missing. </font>
      <p><font size="2">The fifth volume commences with the year 1888. Entries for the period
      Sept 1829 till the end of 1887 are missing. Likewise missing is a volume
      for the period April 1909 to August 1915. </font> 
      <p><font size="2">Marriage registers up to the first half of 1915 are in Portuguese and
      after that in English. It is only in 1888 that provision was made for the
      ages and signatures of the bridal couple. Previously there were signatures
      only of the vicar and witnesses&nbsp; frequently stating their ages and
      villages. </font>
      <h3>Burials</h3>
      <p><font size="2">These registers commence in 1853. Entries fo the year 1861 start in
      March and end in November. No burials for the years 1862 to 1866 are
      found. Burials for 1868 exist and also for two months in 1869. Thereafter
      there is a gap till the end of 1887. </font>
      <p><font size="2">In 1888 the registers resume (in Portuguese) and end in the second half
      of 1915. </font> <p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;
