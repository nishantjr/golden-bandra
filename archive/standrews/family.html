<h3>Family Cell</h3>
Family Power to enrich the Parish

The Family has been identified as the top priority in St. Andrew's in its
mission to be a vibrant Community in which every member is actively involved and
experiences and shares the fullness of life and love. And who will dispute that
the family, where God's precious gift of human life is born and nurtured, is the
starting point for us to experience and share the joy and fruit of Christ's
incomparable promise of 'abundant life'? John 10:10)
The main thrust of the Andrean Family Cell (ANFC) is to empower families and
enrich family life. Unfortunately, there is a misconception that Family Cells
exist only to solve problems in families. This is definitely NOT SO! While
Family Cells are willing to help in times of difficulty, the core reason for
their existence is to enrich family life, so that our homes can truly be
nurturing havens of love, joy and peace.
   Making God the center of our homes, ensures that His values permeate our
lives. He will  help us, husbands and wives, to strengthen our own relationship
and, asparents, to demonstrate His love in parenting.  The Family Cell is one
of the channelsthat the Lord uses to carry out these goals, by assisting
families in developing spiritual,social,  psychological health.  Not only by
personal interaction, but also by arranging get-togethers of parish families
and inviting recognized experts to talk on topics of concern to families.

  Topics such as:
<br>
<ul>
    <li> Parenting
    <li> Cementing Husband-Wife Relationships
    <li> Enjoying our adolescent children
    <li> Keeping romance alive in marriage
    <li> The role of sex in marriage
    <li> Handling the challenges of the married state
    <li> Spiritual enrichment of the family and so on?.
</ul>
 We welcome suggestions from our families on specific areas of interest to them.
The Andrean Family Cell is also looking for parishioners interested or
experienced in interpersonal skills or counseling, to join the Cell. Please
contact Fr Bernard Rodricks at the Parish house or any of our ANFC members named

Do join us in our efforts to bring Abundant Life into our Homes and to use this
Family Power to make St Andrew's Parish a happy, vibrant Community.
