      <P>
      The SCC of these two roads is known as the Community of St. Francis of Assisi. We chose him as our patron because we hope he inspires us to love and care for the environment as he did.&nbsp;
      </P>
      <P>
      We consist of about 55 families spread out from Galaxy up to Seema Apts. Our community has a high proportion of senior citizens and our Core Group members focus specially on them during their visits. There are also some housebound residents who cannot get out due to reasons of ill health or age, and these
      parishioners too are visited regularly.&nbsp;
      </P><P>We have several highly skilled residents who have willingly consented to be resource persons when we have our community get-togethers, and they share their knowledge with us in fields ranging from medicine to psychology.&nbsp;
      Our community holds get-togethers once in two months at Prarthanalaya, where the nuns kindly allow us to use their hall. Those who attend come with snacks which are shared by all.&nbsp;
      At festive times like Christmas, we organize visits to St. Catherine of Siena Orphanage, Ashray, St. Anthony's Home, and sometimes join Sr. Rosita in her visits to the prison. Community members have generously contributed their time and money to bring joy to the less fortunate.&nbsp;
      Core Group Members visit the community residents regularly, and have noticed that this has led to a warm and friendly response from the residents. Earlier, perhaps both sides would have hesitated to make contact, but being a Core Group Member is like a magic password - doors open and people welcome you into their
      homes! This has led to a bonding between residents where there formerly would have been indifference. The Core Group has also met new families who have moved into the area and helped them to get acquainted with the other residents.&nbsp;
      Several members of the community are also members of the B.J. Road ALM and thus we work side by side, building up the community and caring for our road.
