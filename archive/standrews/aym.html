<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">The
youth of our parish have formed a youth group entitled the Andrean
Youth Movement or the AYM. The AYM consists of about 30 members and
meets every Sunday after the 9:30 am mass. The meetings are held&nbsp;on
the ground floor of the&nbsp;Bosco Hall.&nbsp;The AYM is active in
many areas and is a very dynamic group. Julyn Rodrigues is the
president of the AYM.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&nbsp;</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">The AYM
has 3 main spheres on which programmes are based. These are (i)
Formation (ii) Fellowship and (iii) Service. Earlier the group used
to focus equally on all three areas; however, lately they intend to
shift the focus more towards service. This means that they will take
part in and organise more service-oriented programmes. Some such
programmes include the street children programme, the cr&egrave;che
and the various activities of the parish. Most of these programmes
will start in July. There are many more events on the cards. </FONT>

from this, the AYM is in charge of putting together and editing the
'Y-Files', the youth page of our parish bulletin, <FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><A HREF="andreanNotes.html"><U>The

Christmas. They also conduct paper drives, the proceeds of which go
towards their activities. </FONT></FONT>
