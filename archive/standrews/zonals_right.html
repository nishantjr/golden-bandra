<P>The Cultural calendar of Bandra is incomplete without The <B>ZONALS</B>.      
We invite you to this years event ZONALS 2004 which is the 49<SUP>th</SUP>      
Presentation of St. Andrews Parish Annual Zonal Talent      
Contest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P>The last fortyeight performances, the first being in 1953, have      
helped members of St. Andrews discover their capabilities in      
Classical and Non Classical, Vocal and Instrumental Music and in      
Dramatics. For the large number of young people involved with the      
actual organization, the ZONALS has served as a training ground for      
skill in motivating teams of people to achieve challenging goals.      
Many a giant in the music, theatre entertainment and event management      
industry of our city owes the initial discovery of his talent to this      
platform.&nbsp;

material from past Andrean Notes... on two counts. Mr Curry was the editor of 
the Andrean Notes for countless years and almost single handedly carried out the

that were not enough, Mr Curry also took the trouble to preserve copies of the 
Notes over the years and after neatly binding them in volumes, he presented them

<h1><font color="#000080">The Parish Zonal Dramatic Competition&nbsp;</font><o:p>  
-&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">August 1953 (First Zonal Competition)</font></o:p>   
</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Bosco Club have done it     
again – thanks to their splendid idea, their very good effort and their hard     
work, the Parish Zonal Dramatic Competition was an outstanding success; thanks     
also to the Zonal Captains and the Competitors who participated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;     
</span>There are many who can severely criticize and point out the many defects     
of the competition, but they could not have done so before the ‘grand show’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;     
</span>The organizing committee under the direction of Rev. Fr. Nereus Rodrigues     
have done the pioneering of the brand new idea and they have also had to bear     
the brunt of the critics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless,     
they have won their laurels and they have gained a rich experience.&nbsp;<o:p>    
</o:p>    
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The competition was an     
achievement for all the Captains.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They     
mustered out their artistes for the individual items, young and old pianists,     
violinists, mouth organists, singers, elocutionists – an array of 123     
contestants from all four zones was a combined demonstration of the talent among     
the Parishioners of St. Andrew’s – “of a very high standard” as declared     
by the judges and as evidenced before a record audience who witnessed individual     
and group performances of histrionic skill and technique and aesthetic appeal     
beyond their expectations.&nbsp;<o:p>    
</o:p>    
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">The Scheme Zone carried away the     
laurel wreath for their excellent operatic burlesque ‘ANTONIO’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;     
</span>Headed by two notable stage personalities of repute (and that was the     
secret of their success), Mr. Eddie Fonseca and Mrs. Dorothy Roach, and with a     
cast of young handsomes and beauties, success was just around the corner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;     
</span>Nevertheless, they had to put in a lot of effort and hard work to win     
top-place by attaining a high score of 47 points out of 50 ‘with a bang’ of     
a performance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then of course their     
individual artistes were top-performers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Miss     
Fay Sequeira was superb in her singing and with her nightingale voice she was     
unbeatable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Miss Antonette Selkirk     
with her grand piano recital and Master Douglas Rowe with his fine Violin solo     
added a lot more points to give the Scheme Zone a grand total of 64 to win the     
Zonal Championship without argument.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The     
Scheme also won the prize cake for the best sale of tickets.&nbsp;<o:p>    
</o:p>    
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Ranwar was judged fourth –     
best as a group item, but they gathered enough points to give them second place     
in the aggregate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The two     
outstanding character actors as anybody in the audience could see, were Mr.     
Vernon Pereira and Miss Muriel Pereira.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They     
had to run the race, however, with the handicap of the other actors failing to     
come up to their mark, but above all with the sad choice of the play.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;     
</span>Mr. Dick Pereira as the Doctor’s Compounder had so little to do     
otherwise the chances of Ranwar would have been better if, for instance Dick and     
Melville had changed parts.<span style="mso-spacerun:    
yes">&nbsp; </span>Ossie Fonseca and his stage – sweetheart Miss Lourdes     
Pereira were lovers true to type, shall we say?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;     
</span>Ranwar was able to take second place with the points won by 1) Ossie     
Fonseca who played the mouth-organ wonderfully well, 2) Mrs. Mona Aranha who     
sang so divinely and 3) Master Roger Pereira who was a miniature Napoleon with     
his elocution.&nbsp;<o:p>    
</o:p>    
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">St. Paul’s Zone went down     
fighting to the last ditch, and while everybody was sure that they would win     
through, their struggle ended abruptly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The     
Bishop’s Candlesticks’ afforded the best scope for Dramatics and both     
Ferdinand Miranda and Reggie Coelho soared high in the histrionic atmosphere –     
the contrast of the two characters the Bishop and the convict was accentuated by     
each other’s character portrayal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Miss     
Rene Ferreira was the typical woman found in clergy homes-grumbling against     
charity, solicitous about the things of this world, the prototype of Martha in     
the Bible story.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>St.Paul’s     
were also at a disadvantage in that they had only one individual contestant, Mr.     
Ferdinand Miranda, who with his splendid baritone voice sang with Paul Robeson     
style to bring St. Paul’s total a little higher.&nbsp;<o:p>    
</o:p>    
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Hill Road and Chimbai Zone     
deserved unstinted praise and they got it from the Panel of Judges who declared     
that their item ‘Mama’s Delight’ was singled out for Originality,     
Stage-setting and Juvenile performance-a thing of beauty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;     
</span>The Doll’s shop was pretty beyond compare and the Dolls were perfectly     
costumed and each one performed excellently well.<span style="mso-spacerun:    
yes">&nbsp; </span>This was the only group item that was an original creation     
written by the Zonal Captain Mr. C. Curry who also assisted Miss Betty Vincent     
in training the little children to perform with such grace and perfection.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;     
</span>The play captured everyone, but the Mama Doll stole the hearts of     
everyone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, this     
beautiful play earned only 35 points.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To     
add to this score there was only one individual item performer Mr. Anthony Pinto     
who played the violin in a masterly manner, to win 7 points the highest secured     
by any individual.&nbsp;<o:p>    
</o:p>    
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">We have heard so much said in     
praise of the Judges and the difficult task they had in judging the winners in a     
competition so closely contested and so varied in its items.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;     
</span>We need say no more, but we must now give unstinted praise to those     
judges who were faced with a far more difficult job in selecting only eight out     
of 123 performers for the finals, during a six hour period for two days at the     
elimination contest – and what a fine job they did make of it.&nbsp;<o:p>    
</o:p>    
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It would be most fair to make     
special mention of three Committee members who virtually slaved for the success     
of the competition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mr. Alfred     
Netto, Mr. Leslie Britto and Mr. Melville Mendes -<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;     
</span>We take our hat off to them and to the organizing Committee for doing     
such a magnificient job of the 1953 Zonal Dramatic Competition of St. Andrew’s     
Parish held on 23<sup>rd</sup> August 1953.</p>    
<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">The President of the evening was the Rt. Rev. Mgr. V.     
Dyer, Vicar General.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">&nbsp;    
</span>In his speech     
he expressed his admiration and appreciation of the function in which the     
Parishioners of St. Andrew’s had shown such rich talent in music and drama.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">&nbsp;

Vicar, Rev. Fr. Henry Remedios then raised a vote of thanks to the President and     
the Judges, and to every single one who shared in the work of making the     
function a splendid success.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">&nbsp; </span>The

Wilfred Pereira Challenge Trophy</b><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p> 

<p style='text-align:justify'>The Second Parish Zonal Dramatic    
Competition was held at St. Andrews High School Hall, on Sunday, August 22<sup>nd</sup>    
“The Scheme” zone (last year’s winners) again proved that they had the cream of    
the talent in their zone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Besides    
winning the main dramatic event with their presentation of “FERDINAND THE BULL”    
a burlesque with picturesque Spanish setting, they secured first place in five    
of the eight individual items.<![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>    

<p style='text-align:justify'>All four zones were truly    
enthusiastic about the success of the competition.<span style="mso-spacerun:    
yes">  </span>They vied with each other in bringing out the talented young and    
old artistes to sing and play and dance and dramatise.<span    
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>No pains were spared in getting appropriate    
stage settings and gorgeous costumes; much time was sacrificed for practices    
which were sometimes carried on till the early hours of the morning.<span    
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>‘Team-work’ was the motto of every zone.<![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>    

<p style='text-align:justify'>There was variety in the plays    
presented; a welcome contrast balanced gay burlesque with pure drama.<span    
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Five judges were at their wits end in    
declaring the order of merit which proved quite a task for them.<span    
style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>This year a magnificient trophy was    
presented by Mr. Wilfred Pereira – a trophy that stirred the competitors on to    
better efforts.<![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>    

<p style='text-align:justify'>A responsive audience packed the    
hall to capacity to witness the entertainment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     
</span>The judges called it a colossal success.<span style="mso-spacerun:    
yes">  </span>The President, Mr. Wilfred Pereira was impressed by the    
enthusiasm of the competing zones; Rev. Fr. Henry Remedios our Vicar was    
overwhelmed and overjoyed at the grand success of the competition.<![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>    

<p style='text-align:justify'>The Bosco Club was given due    
praise for the able and efficient manner in which they conducted the    
competition under the direction of the Hon. Secretary Mr. Melville Mendes.<span    
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Everybody was being congratulated by    
everybody.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What a Show !<span    
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>What a success !.<![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>    

<h2 style='text-align:justify'><b>Observations</b></h2>

<p style='text-align:justify'>It was apparent after the    
eliminations that there was no scope for real competition -<span    
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Scheme Zone had seven contestants for    
the individual events.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Ranwar had four,    
St. Paul had three and Hill Road had two – it was a foregone conclusion that    
only the Scheme would win the trophy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">     
</span>If the talented are greater in number in one particular zone it goes    
without saying that the scope of competition does not exist.<![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>    

<p style='text-align:justify'>The Organizing Committee must bear   
this in mind at next year’s competition, and the competing zones must be   
prepared to accept whatever arrangement will be arrived at for real healthy   
competition next year.<![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>   

<h2 style='text-align:justify'><b>Lost marks</b><![endif]><o:p></o:p></h2>  

<p style='text-align:justify'>The Scheme lost marks on account   
of the chatting and whisperings that went on by the Spanish Belles clustered   
around the fruit stalls, and for not synchronizing their singing with the music   
accompaniment.<![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>Ranwar was severely penalized for   
the manner in which the Ladies of the Welfare Committee gossiped away as each   
one finished her stage part, and for the exeunt of performers after   
performance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>St. Paul suffered loss of   
marks heavily because of the very glaring defect of Scenery and because players   
were hidden by players during performance.<![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>   

<p style='text-align:justify'>Marks were slashed from Hill Road   
because of the use of the mike in the wrong place and for some defects in   
direction.<![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h2><font color="#000080">Colossal success<![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;</font><![endif]><o:p></o:p></h2>   

<p style='text-align:justify'>We reproduce here Mr. Cecil   
Mendoza’s comment which appeared in The Indian Express.<![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>   

<p style='text-align:justify'>“The finals of the Second parish   
zonal dramatic competition under the auspices of the Bosco Club of Bandra held   
at the St. Andrew’s High School Hall, Bandra, on Sunday turned out to be a   
colossal success.<![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>   

<p style='text-align:justify'>“Rev. Father Henry Remedios the   
Vicar of St. Andrew’s Church divided his parish into four zones known as the Scheme.<span   
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>St. Paul Road, Ranwar and Hill Road.<![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>   

<p style='text-align:justify'>“Each zone contributed a   
play.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>‘Ferdinand the Bull,’ more like a   
skit on the famous Spanish sport, produced and enacted by ‘The Scheme’ was   
colourful and tuneful containing a very appropriate gypsy dance.<![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>   

<p style='text-align:justify'>The other musical play ‘And So It   
Goes On’ by the Ranwar group finished with an American ministrel show which was   
the most jovial item of the programme.</p>   

<p style='text-align:justify'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;‘Kismet’ staged by the St. Paul’s   
group centralized too much on Hajj, the Beggar played by Mr. Reggie Coelho that   
the play seemed to lack interest towards the final stages.<![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>   

<p style='text-align:justify'>But Miss Waters as Yasmin the   
daughter of Hajj was very spectacular in her oriental dance.<![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>   

<p style='text-align:justify'>There were 12 final contestants   
in the vocal or instrumental section and the general standard was quite good,   
especially of the young violinists who showed that their training is on the   
right lines.<![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>   

<p style='text-align:justify'>There were five judges and Mr.   
Sam Berkley-Hill gave an interesting critical resume of the dramatic section.<![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>   

<p style='text-align:justify'>The Wilfred Pereira Trophy was   
awarded to ‘The Scheme’.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Some of the   
audience felt that the ‘Hill Road’ zone could have tied with the winners.<![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>   

<p style='text-align:justify'>* The use of the microphone   
adjusted in an uncouth position was the undoing of Hill Road.<![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>   

<p style='text-align:justify'>For originality of conception Mr.   
Carlisle Curry who wrote ‘The Secret’ must be congratulated.<![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>   

<p style='text-align:justify'>Mrs. W. Pereira gave away the   
Trophy and the prizes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The proceeds of   
the performance were in aid of the St. Andrew’s Educational Charities.&nbsp; </p>
