The Centre for Community Organisation (CCO) is a secular body recently set up in the St. Andrew’s Parish,
Bandra.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p> <font size="2"><b> The purpose of the CCO is to co-ordinate the activities of the various Associations/Cells operating in the Parish with the various NGO’s operating within the Parish catchment’s area for the benefit of all residents in
Bandra.  </b></font></p>
<p><font size="2">The CCO has the following vision:</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font color="#000080"><b>TO BE THE PREFERRED CENTRE &amp; MEDIUM THROUGH WHICH PERSONS/ORGANISATIONS OF ALL FAITHS GET INVOLVED &amp; HARMONIOUSLY INTEGRATE THEIR ACTIVITIES FOR A TRANSFORMED SOCIETY, ESPECIALLY BY WAY OF SOCIAL ACTION.</b></font></font></p>
<p><font size="2">To achieve the above, the Parish has made available facilities
like:&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2">The Bosco Hall for hosting seminars/conferences. It has the infrastructure to accommodate approx. 200 people with aids like projectors
etc.<br>
A fortnightly leaflet called “The Happening” which lists ensuing programmes to be held in the Bosco Hall &amp; also functions around
Bandra.</font></p>
