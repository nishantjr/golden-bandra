<h3>Civic and Political Cell</h3>

<P>The Civic and Political Cell of the parish, was inaugurated on the
30th April 2001.&nbsp; At this meeting, the aims of the cell were
spelt out viz.</P>
<P>1. To take on the role of conscientising our communities on how
they could tackle local issues, rather than depending on others to
solve their problems, and</P>
<P>2. To encourage involvement in political affairs, the election
process, conducting 'know your candidate' meetings etc.</P>
<P>At a subsequent meeting, Mr Robert Serrao, of&nbsp; I. C.Parish,
Borivali, who was the archdiocesean coordinator of Civic and
Political cells, gave us some guidelines on how the cell should
function.&nbsp; Other members of his team, Mr. Willie Shirsat &amp;
Mr. Joe Corda, provided valuable inputs&nbsp; 
</P>
<P>Among their suggestions were the following:</P>
<P>-form of core team of seven or eight members preferably those
already involved socially, politically, or working with some NGO.</P>
<P>-start networking with AGNI, Bombay Catholics Sabha, Residents
assns. etc.</P>
<P>-put up a separate notice board, to announce the activities of the
cell..</P>
<P>During the last municipal elections, the cell took on the massive
task of updating the voters list, in coordination with AGNI. Members
went around each area and enlisted the eligible voters, and new
voters 
</P>
<P>One of the projects currently underway is to create awareness in
every family, about the segregate wet and dry waste and to encourage
them to adopt methods for the composting of wet waste. With this in
mind, the cell set up a stall during the Andrean Fiesta, to promote
Solid Waste Management.</P>
<P>Many of our members are active in their ALM groups and attend the
monthly meetings at the BMC ward office.&nbsp; The cell hopes to tap
their rich experience in spreading Civic and political awareness in
the parish. 
</P>
<P>(Update as on 30th April 2004.)</P>
<P>Demolition of Crossed &amp; Shrines</P>
<P>The Cell spearheaded the campaign against the demolition of
crosses and shrines not only in the parish but also in the
surrounding parishes in the deanery: by making representations to the
BMC, collection of old records for presentation in court by the
Catholic Sabha, conscientizing the parishioners on how to resist any
threatened demolition.</P>
<P>Electoral Rolls:</P>
<P>Created awareness on the procedure for updating the voters' lists,
the dates, timings and addresses of the various centres for additions
,deletions and corrections etc.</P>
<P>Campaign for Secular Candidates 
</P>
<P>Organised speakers from 'Insaniyat&quot; to address parishioners
after area masses on the dangers of voting for candidates put up by
communal parties.</P>
<P>ALM Activity</P>
<P>Formed an ALM support Group aimed at nurturing new and intending
activists to establish ALMs in their areas. The group is open to
people of all faiths and meets on the last Sunday of every month in
the Bosco Hall.
