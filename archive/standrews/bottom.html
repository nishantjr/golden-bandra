<p>St.Andrew's, the oldest existing church in Bandra, was built by the
Portuguese around the year 1600 on the shores of the Arabian Sea. Its
massive masonary walls support a gabled, tiled roof topped by a Cross rising
58 feet into the skies above. This Cross was once a dominant and familiar
landmark on Bandra's skyline, though, in today's highrise Bandra the Church
is dwarfed by the surrounding buildings. Nevertheless, St Andrew's Parish
continues to foster a vibrant community and strives to provide an
environment for the spiritual and overall growth of its members. This
website is a part of that endeavour.</p>
<p>

The website has at least three 'reasons for being'. <br><br>
1. The site provides valuable background, historical and archival information about our venerable institution.<br><br>2. It intends to keep parishioners informed about current events in the many happening areas of the parish - activities in the 23 SCC locations, the cells and organisations, events organised weekly by the Communication Group, feasts and special events like the Parish Zonal Competitions.<br><br>3. Perhaps the more important reason for the site is that it affords a medium for interaction between the members of the parish community, to foster and enhance the live sense of community and kinship that Bandra and St Andrew's value so much.
<BR>
The Andrean Web Team invites involvement and hopes that our parishioners
will actively participate in the website and help to shape and maintain it.</p>
