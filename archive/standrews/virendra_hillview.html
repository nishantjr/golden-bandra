      <P>The ‘Y’ community of our parish is located at at Hill View and Virendra colony. This 
community consists of 84 families and its patron is Pope John XXIII. 
<br><br>
<u>October 2003</u><br> A rosary was held at Virendra Colony, but the response was poor. 
<br><br>
<u>November 2003</u><br> We had planned to have a recollection but as it did not happen, it was 
planned for February 2004. 
<br><br>
<u>December 2003</u><br> Core group members sent Christmas Cards to the priests of the Parish 
and to every home in the community. 
The other activites conducted included visiting the sick and sending home made paper 
bags, plastic bags and rags to Shanti Avedhna. </P></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
