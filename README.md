This repository is organized into the following directories:

-   `items/` contain items in the collection. These may be articles, images, maps, etc.
    Sub-directories are merely for organizational purposes and may be nested as desired.

-   `periods/` contain the summaries for each of the major historical periods.

-   `collections/` will eventually contain summaries for other groupings of articles (e.g. the St Andrew by-the-sea book)

-   `www/` contains technical infrastructure for building the website
