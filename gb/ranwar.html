<p>Navigating the permanent traffic jam that is Hill Road today,
visitors to Bandra might be tempted to escape life-and-limb threatening
traffic by using a sleepy, narrow <em>gully</em> called Langrana Lane
that takes off to the south of ‘Hill Road’ near the Holy Family
Hospital. And if they did so, they would suddenly find themselves in a
different world. Old style cottages and double storeyed buildings with
red ‘Mangalore’ tiles on their roofs, along a narrow road that seems to
wind erratically to dodge the houses located haphazardly, without
apparent rhyme or reason. This is Ranwar, one of the original 24
<em>pakhadis</em> that made up Bandra since the earliest documented
history in early 1700s. And it has managed to retain its village
character even as present-day ‘development’ has hemmed it in on all
sides.</p>

<p>Ranwar today, is the confusion of houses adjoining a central street,
Veronica Street. This narrow lane meanders from Waroda Road in the
north, roughly in a southward direction, barely a quarter of a kilometer
in length and emerges in the St. Sebastian’s Housing Scheme, which in
turn abuts on the Bandra Reclamation. The street itself was probably
named around 1906-07, when a prominent resident of Ranwar, Peter
Pereira, was municipal councillor in what was then the Bandra
Municipality. The reason it is called Veronica Street relates to a
traditional Christian tableau held in the season of Lent during Passion
Week, depicting the events surrounding the death of Jesus. In those
days, a girl playing the role of Veronica, one of the followers of
Christ, was formally dressed in a house in Ranwar and carried on a
palanquin in procession to St Andrew Church.</p>
<p>During the solemn procession, when Christ carried his cross to
Calvary, there was an annual re-enactment of the scene that took place
about 2000 years ago, when, unable to bear the sight of Christ suffering
and staggering under the whips and lances of the Roman soldiers,
Veronica approached him with a soothing cloth to wipe his bloody face.
In recognition of her courage and compassion, the legend has it,
Veronica was left with an image of Christ’s face on the cloth she used.
This re-enactment is performed even today, though Veronica no longer
sallies forth from Ranwar as she once did.</p>
<p>In 1534, Bahadur Shah of Gujarat, who ruled over this area, ceded the
coastal tract from Bombay to beyond Bassein, to the Portuguese. This
included the island of Salsette, of which Bandra was part. At the time
Bandra was composed of 25 <em>pakhadis</em> or hamlets and Ranwar may
well have been one of them. In 1548 Bandra along with other places was
granted by the Portuguese Crown to Antonio Pesoa and his wife Isabel
Botelho for the duration of their lives. By 1568 Antonio Pesoa and
Isabel Botelho had both expired and the Portuguese Crown granted Bandra
to the Jesuits as a revenue source to support their work.</p>
<p>In 1583 the first place of public Catholic worship was constructed on
the shores of the Mahim creek. It was called Santa Anna. The
non-parochial St Andrew was built around 1599-1601. By 1616 the Catholic
population was around 6,000 and there was felt the need for another
parish in Bandra. The <em>Koli</em> portion of the Bandra Catholic
population was assigned to the Church of St Andrew. Ranwar, a
<em>pakhadi</em> of cultivators, remained part of the old Santa Anna
parish.</p>
<p>As far as preserved historical records are concerned, the earliest
reference to Ranwar dates to 1716, pertaining to a birth entry in the
Register of the Church of Santa Anna, now kept at St Andrew Church. The
residents then were the Pereiras, Fonsecas, Pessoas, Gomes, Gracias,
Rodrigues Dias and Gonsalves and others.</p>
<p>Another prominent family, the Xaviers, were originally Pereiras. The
legend has it that in the 1700s the family was travelling to Goa by sea
and their boat was caught in a terrible storm. In mortal fear of their
lives they fell on their knees and prayed to St Francis Xavier to spare
their lives. This duly done, they immediately changed their name from
‘Pereira’ to ‘Xavier’ in acknowledgement of the debt they owed the
saint.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this, there was always a predominance of Pereiras in
Ranwar. In fact there is still a saying doing the rounds today, among
non-Pereiras of course, that if you throw a stone in Ranwar you would
hit either a Pereira or a pig. Nowadays though, the Pereiras would be
more at risk, since for more than the last forty years, free-range pigs,
once a common sight on the streets in villages like Ranwar, are a thing
of the past.</p>
<p>Equally lost in time, are the unforgettable pig-chases, occasions
when the animals were chased frantically all over the village,
indiscriminately invading gardens and even verandas and crossing roads
and culminating in ultimate capture, which was heralded by the ear
shattering squeals and grunts of the doomed animal. This event happened
a few times each year, especially just before Christmas, Easter and the
Bandra Feast, a precursor to the sarpotel, vindaal and delicious
sausages that appear on every village table on the feast day.</p>
<p>In earlier days, the area was mostly given to rice cultivation though
there were also extensive vegetable gardens. The region in fact was
noted for a special variety of sweet onions, which until recently could
be seen hanging in bundles in almost every local kitchen. In addition
there were coconut groves along the shore and mango orchards inland, all
owned by the Jesuits.</p>
<p>Ranwar itself was a rice-producing village and this can be deduced
from the arrangement of the houses in the village. Rice farmers
traditionally are loath to waste a good paddy field on building houses.
Villages of rice farmers, unlike those of vegetable growers, therefore
are invariably built on high ground or on rocky outcrops and perforce
are built close to one another with the streets having to thread their
way between houses as best they can. Safety was another reason: pirates
regularly raided the area because of the rich pickings available. Even
today, there are residents who can recall stories told by grandparents
about how their parents every so often had to flee to the fields because
of reports of marauding bands in the area.</p>
<p>Ranwar was a tenant village of the Jesuits until 1739 when the
Portuguese evacuated Bandra and the Marathas took possession of it. In
December 1774, the Marathas were ejected by the British who allowed the
farmers to become proprietors of the land they cultivated. And very good
land it was, both because of its fertility and situation. At the time
commerce between the mainland and British Bombay was by ferry from
Bandra, which in those days was an important, if minor port, as can be
judged by the fort that still exists in part at Land’s End. It was also
a major access route to Bombay harbour via Sion. (This was when Bombay
was still a set of islands and the Sion Causeway didn’t exist)</p>
<p>At that time the port was near where the mosque on S.V. Road now
stands and Ranwar was just a farmer’s hop step and jump away. Bombay
already was a commercial hub and most of rice and vegetable imports were
from and through Bandra. This was a golden era for Ranwar judging from
the houses that were built at the time. The earliest constructions still
standing, date back to those years.</p>
<p>This situation changed in 1845 when the Mahim Causeway was built and
even more in 1867 when the railway line was laid. Beside the loss of
trade, siltation due to the causeway and the railway bridge soon made
the port unviable. Ranwar was no longer near the ‘front door’ to Bombay.
However, the improved communications made for new opportunities. Job
opportunities in Bombay now increased.</p>
<p>In 1792, Fr Francis de Mello of Povoacao, now D’monte Street,
initiated literacy classes in a shed within St Andrew’s Church compound.
The language of instruction was Portuguese and thus students from
Bandra, including Ranwar, which was the closest <em>pakhadi</em> to the
Church, became acquainted with the Roman script.</p>
<p>This familiarity with the Roman script enabled them to learn English,
which was a necessity in commercial Bombay. By the second half of the
nineteenth century an English medium school, the St Stanislaus
institution, had opened. Likewise a girls’ school, St Joseph’s Convent
had commenced classes in 1863. Students who wished to study further and
appear for their matriculation, went to Bombay.</p>
<p>Agriculture for many was no longer the main livelihood and this was
fortunate because there was now need for alternate use of the land.</p>
<p><img src="images/BandraMapOldLow72.jpg" /></p>
<p>A pestilence was recorded in Bandra in 1700, which severely affected
cultivation. Later in the nineteenth century epidemics of typhoid,
cholera etc are known to have afflicted Bandra. The old villages, with
the houses crowded together were death traps. In the closing years of
the nineteenth century, the bubonic plague killed hundreds of
inhabitants.</p>
<p>Detailed records of Catholic victims are preserved in the registers
of the churches of St Andrew, St Peter and Mount Carmel. Whenever the
plague struck, people would flee to the relative safety of temporary
shelters in their fields.</p>
<p>Signs of those times still survive today. At almost every extremity
of the village there are religious shrines as a means of obtaining
divine protection from the dread disease. And even today, one of the
invocations said during the family Rosary <em>“St Roque and St Sebastian
save us from plague and pestilence”</em> bears witness to the very real
danger that this affliction posed for villages like Ranwar.</p>
<p>Because of the frequency of the epidemics, many of the new educated
gentry now began building houses in what were once their rice fields to
the south of the original village, and this marked the second phase of
house construction in the village.</p>
<p>Ranwar has had a very close and active community down the years. The
many organisations that were and still are active in the area are
witness to that. Around 1924, well before the Bandra Gymkhana started,
the <em>Rest Ranwar</em> was founded by a group of Ranwarites.</p>
<p>The club produced expert badminton, tennis, cricket football and
hockey and other sportspeople down the years. It has a small pavilion
for indoor activities as well as outdoor playing grounds. The annual
Christmas and New Year dances at the ‘<em>Rest</em>’ as it was popularly
known, attracted crowds from all over Bombay. Today, after being dormant
for many years, the Club is being revived once again.</p>
<p>Ranwar was also home to a literary group, called <em>The Varsity
Circle</em>, founded by a group of men from Bandra. They conducted
debates and held talks on various topics of interest and also produced a
magazine. This was handwritten in classic copperplate script, and which
was in great demand even outside the circle of members.</p>
<p>The Varsity Circle was a literary training ground for the members and
two of the founders later went on to become principals, one of St John
the Baptist High School, Thane and the other of St Teresa’s High School,
Girgaum. The Varsity Circle encouraged literary, acting and public
speaking talent.</p>
<p>Another founder was the renowned, author and playwright, Arty Pereira
or ‘Doc’, who through the years trained hundred’s of students. His book
<em>Success in 30 Days</em> written in the 1950s was a best seller when
first published (and is still in print). Thirty years after his death,
people from all over the country were still writing letters to him, to
thank him and to tell of the effect the book has had on their lives.</p>
<p>Any story of Ranwar would be woefully incomplete without mention of
the Ranwar Funds. These are chit funds, the oldest of which, was started
more than 150 years ago and which is still running smoothly. There are
the seasonal funds meant to provide a lump sum at times of extra
expenses. And so there is the <em>Christmas Saving Fund</em>, the Bandra
<em>Feast Fund</em> and the <em>Monsoon Fund</em>. And finally there is
the <em>Death Benefit Fund</em>, which was once one of the most
appreciated. On the day of the death of a member, an envelope would be
discreetly handed over to the family to meet the expenses of the
funeral.</p>
<p>Besides, the monetary benefits, the chit ‘Funds’ and groups that have
endured for decades, are perhaps the very reason why village communities
like Ranwar have been so close knit. Every year, all the members would
gather for an Annual Meeting, which was both business and pleasure. Even
today, when the original financial objectives of the Funds hardly
matter, membership is full, and often passed on as an inheritance.
Annual dinners are well attended and start with the statement of
accounts being read, queried and passed after which the mandatory
<em>khimaad</em>, a potent, typically East Indian brew, made from
‘country’ alcohol, tea and spices and drunk piping hot, is served. This
is a point in the proceedings that advertises itself to the neighboring
residents in no uncertain terms, for after a few sips of
<em>khimaad</em> the decibel level of the gathering increases
logarithmically. Earlier the country liquor was locally procured, even
during the prohibition era, when the area around Ranwar was the source
of some of the finest brews in town.</p>
<p>Perhaps the quaintest of the groups, and something unique to Ranwar,
is the ‘<em>One-Four Fund</em>’. This, women’s group was started more
than 50 years ago. The name derives from the monthly contribution of
each member. For years it stayed put at a rupee and four annas. There
were 12 members originally and one rupee was for the monthly share,
while the four annas was the social contribution, out of which these
amazing women produced their sumptuous, monthly dinner. Every home
cooked dinner is a gourmet’s delight. Membership was in such demand that
membership was expanded to 24. Even when the women move out of Ranwar,
they still retain membership. There is a waiting list for new members
with special rights for a child of a deceased member.</p>
<p>The village today, like all the other heritage villages in Bandra is
under siege. Present day Ranwar reflects changed times. The once quiet,
peaceful lanes are now bustling thoroughfares for traffic seeking a
short route from the Bandra Reclamation to ‘Hill Road’ and beyond. The
ever-present dust and noise and a dozen traffic jams a day are now
accepted with stoic resignation.</p>
<p><img src="images/ranwar2610Low.jpg" data-border="0" width="450"
height="360" /></p>
<p>The most telling and poignant reminder of an era gone forever, is the
sight today of village doors, closed in the daytime. Was a time a few
years ago, when the door to every home, was opened at daybreak or a
little before and kept open the entire day through, with little, swivel
wooden doorstops at the bottom to prevent the wind from slamming them
shut. Both the front and the back entrances were left wide open,
welcoming neighbours and friends who might happen to drop in. Theft was
a rarity as was the presence of a stranger in the neighbourhood. Every
passerby was a familiar face and most called out a greeting or stopped
for a short chat and a bit of gossip. Time was to spend in renewing
contacts constantly.</p>
<p>Change is inevitable and to resist change is futile and foolish.
Perhaps localities and lifestyles, now in their twilight, will give way
to different, eventually equally rich and valuable experiences. If that
is so, then the present, impersonal and sometimes adversary
relationships nurtured by today’s housing societies and high rises can
be viewed as a transient feature, en route.</p>
<p>And meanwhile, one can even today, travel to places like Gorai and
Uttan to the north, or south to Korlai and Rev Danda and catch a glimpse
of yesterday’s Ranwar, or Pali or Sherly. Of quiet, shady lanes between
quiet, peaceful, red tiled houses and, if one is patient, the sight of a
mother hen and several cheeping chicks trickling across the street in
search of a scratched meal, or a lone, grunting pig, rooting around -
tomorrow’s pork vindaal on hooves. But for how long will these quaint
places endure? Development, that dread tide in our affairs and lives,
cannot be far off and with it more cause for wistful nostalgia.</p>
