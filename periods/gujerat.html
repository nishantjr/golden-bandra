      <h1> Gujerat </h1>
      <p>Portuguse-Gujerat interactions cover three distinct periods.
Initially, when the Portuguese were struggling to find a foothold in the
South, the Zamorin in Calicut formed an alliance with the more powerful
Gujerat Sultanate which sent contingents, both naval and land based
forces, in support. Once the Portuguese had fought back these assaults,
Gujerat was forced on to the defensive by the far superior Portuguese
naval forces and though they were strongly supported internationally,
initially by the Fatimid Rulers in Egypt and then by the Ottoman Empire
which replaced the Fatimidâ€™s, the Portuguese had the upper hand and
Gujerat wasn fighting a losing battle. When Hjmayub attacked Gujerat IN
15NN THE Sultan Bahdur decided tht the Mughals were the more dangerous
enemy and made peace with the Portuguese in 1534. However when Humayun
had to withdraw from the scene Bahadur once again commenced hostilities
which continued till 1548 when Bahadur died under somewhat mysterious
circumstances while boarding a Poortuguese flagship for talks with the
Portuguese commander. After that, Gujerat could only be of nuisance
value to the Portuguese who slowly consolidated their position in the
Konkan.</p>
