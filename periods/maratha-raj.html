      <h1> Maratha Raj </h1>
      <p>The Maratha reign was shortlived, from 1739 to 1775, yet it had a
major impact on the erstwhile Portuguese territory. They extorted the
area ruthlessly, imposing almost a hundred new taxes and cesses, driving
the population almost to destitution. One significant consequence was
that the Koli community which earlier was subservient to the Kunbis were
now more prosperous. While the professed reason for the Maratha invasion
was the reestablishment of the hindu dharma, in practice the Marathas
were much more benevolent to the Christians and apart from a ghar wapasi
campaign to woo the converted population, they allowed them much greater
freedom than the Portguuese had allowed the hindus. In 1761, after the
disaster at Panipat at the hands of Abdullah ??? the Marthas loosed
their grip on the conquered territory and the locals now rebuilt the
burnt out Mt Mary Chapel and repaired St Andrewâ€™s whose roof had been
burnt in the war. But they also introduced a far more usorious revenue
system which impoverished the area even further. In the meantime, the
English had grown in power and were now able to successfully overcome
the marthas in a series of wars. In the process they also took control
of Salsette and after some unsettled years otok over the area.</p>
