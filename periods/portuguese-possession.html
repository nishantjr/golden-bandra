      <h1> Portuguese Possession </h1>
      <p>The Portuguese presence in the western coast was mostly littoral ,
sufficient for them to have a broad enough base to facilitate their
Ocean Empire where they largely controlled all trade in the area.
Portuguese power waned from 1580 when Spain and Portugal were united
under one crown. As a result erstwhile allies like the English and the
Dutch who were at enmity with the Spanish turned foes and gradually but
surely undermined Portuguese dominance. In 1665The Portuguese used a
marriage contract to try and ensure English assistance against the Dutch
but unfortunately for them this did not materialise. Portugal also had
turned its face towards Brazil where the returns were much better than
India and the Portuguese in India received increasing less military
support from the mother country while the Marathas grew more powerful.
Eventually, when the Peshwas, whose motherland was the Konkan, took
control of the Maratha campaign, they took a personal interest in a
establishing control of the region and in 1737 launched a blitzkrieg
with the support of disgruntled locals, frustrated by the religious
repression of hindusim and by 1739, after a siege of Bassien which was
heroically defended by the Portuguese, they were victorious.</p>
