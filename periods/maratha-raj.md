The Maratha reign was shortlived, from 1739 to 1775, yet it had a major impact
on the erstwhile Portuguese territory.
They extorted the area ruthlessly, imposing almost a hundred new taxes and cesses,
driving the population almost to destitution.
One significant consequence was that the Koli community which
earlier was subservient to the Kunbis were now more prosperous.
While the professed reason for the Maratha invasion was the reestablishment of the hindu dharma, in practice the Marathas were much more benevolent to the Christians and
apart from a ghar wapasi campaign to woo the converted population, they allowed
them much greater freedom than the Portguuese had allowed the hindus. In 1761,
after the disaster at Panipat at the hands of Abdullah ??? the Marthas loosed
their grip on the conquered territory and the locals now rebuilt the burnt out
Mt Mary Chapel and repaired St Andrew's whose roof had been burnt in the war.
But they also introduced a far more usorious revenue system which impoverished
the area even further. In the meantime, the English had grown in power and were
now able to successfully overcome the marthas in a series of wars. In the
process they also took control of Salsette and after some unsettled years otok
over the area.
