      <h1> British Authority </h1>
      <p>The British had always coveted Salsette s potential as the granary of
the islands of Bombay. The wars had devastated the economy of the region
and at the turn of the 19th century, they instituted a series of revenue
reforms or Land Settlements which gave the cultivators prescriptive
rights to the lands and this resulted in a very rapid increase in
agricultural production. This is turn made the cultivators prosperous
and Bandra was soon one of the most forward villages in the region. In
1548, the Parsi magnate Jamsettjee Jeejeebhoy (or more accurately hiss
wife) funded the building of a causeway from Mahim to Bandra which gave
a huge fillip to trade and standards of living in Bandra. Bandra soon
became one of the most prosperous places in the North Konkan . The
English encouraged Bombayite s to invest in the development of the area
and new road s, Hill Road and Byramjee Jeebhoy Road were builtvin South
Bandra which led to a rapid development of the area. This in turn
spirrud the villages in the North to seek the same good fortune and they
were able to lobby successfully for Pali Road to be built and now North
Bandra also shared in the good times. The new migrants and the local
gerty became more active in civil matters and very soon the Bandra
Municipality was in place.</p>
