      <h1> Town Planning Schemes </h1>
      <p>TPS Town Planning schemes beginning 1918 soon generated a series of
changes in Bandra which larely made it what it was for the next half
century and which made Bandra the Queen of the Suburbs. After the plague
in Bombay, there was need for accommodation for the burgeoning
population and the government launched an ambitious and extremely
progressive development programme The TPS program) Initially it was
implemented by the local government (TPS 1 and 2) but then the Bombay
government set up a development board with better resources, financial
and managerial. The schenes were among the most advanced, even as
compared to European countries, [preserving the environment while
catering to the ever increasing demand for accommodation. There were
about a 100 such schemes in Salsette and soon the increasing demand
resulted in a dilution of some of the most attractive aspects of the
TPS. But the Bandra Municipality resisted the populist tendencies that
resulted in the rest of the Salsette schemes being diluted . While other
suburbs, from Andheri to Chembur, allowed for greater congestion and
higher buildings, Bandra remained a garden city with bungalows each with
a garden.</p>
