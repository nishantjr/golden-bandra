The British had always coveted Salsette s potential as the granary of the
islands of Bombay. The wars had devastated the economy of the region and at the
turn of the 19th century, they instituted a series of revenue reforms or Land
Settlements which gave the cultivators prescriptive rights to the lands and this
resulted in a very rapid increase in agricultural production. This is turn made
the cultivators prosperous and Bandra was soon one of the most forward villages
in the region. In 1548, the Parsi magnate Jamsettjee Jeejeebhoy (or more
accurately hiss wife) funded the building of a causeway from Mahim to Bandra
which gave a huge fillip to trade and standards of living in Bandra. Bandra soon
became one of the most prosperous places in the North Konkan . The English
encouraged Bombayite s to invest in the development of the area and new road s,
Hill Road and Byramjee Jeebhoy Road were builtvin South Bandra which led to a
rapid development of the area. This in turn spirrud the villages in the North to
seek the same good fortune and they were able to lobby successfully for Pali
Road to be built and now North Bandra also shared in the good times. The new
migrants and the local gerty became more active in civil matters and very soon
the Bandra Municipality was in place.
