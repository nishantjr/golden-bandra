title: Coopertive Schemes

A major contributor to making Bandra a garden city was the role of two
cooperative schemes, the Salsette and St Sebastian Schemes. Both of these were
the brainchild of FAC Rebello who had been a prominent member of the Bombay
government scene. Because of deep knowledge of how the schemes were designed, he
was able to merge the Cooperative Act of 1915 with the Town Planning A00ct of
19nn, He was able to get the local landowners, both the large properties and the
smaller one with fractional land holdings to pool their lands and in return
receive developed plots. Members were encouraged to develop their plots
according to their means and were provided loans to do so. . As result the
Cooperative schemes were models of self development nd the benefits persisted
long after the rest of Greater Bombay succumbed to the pressure of development
exigencies
