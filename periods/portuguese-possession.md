The Portuguese presence in the western coast was mostly littoral , sufficient
for them to have a broad enough base to facilitate their Ocean Empire where they
largely controlled all trade in the area. Portuguese power waned from 1580 when
Spain and Portugal were united under one crown. As a result erstwhile allies
like the English and the Dutch who were at enmity with the Spanish turned foes
and gradually but surely undermined Portuguese dominance. In 1665The Portuguese
used a marriage contract to try and ensure English assistance against the Dutch
but unfortunately for them this did not materialise. Portugal also had turned
its face towards Brazil where the returns were much better than India and the
Portuguese in India received increasing less military support from the mother
country while the Marathas grew more powerful. Eventually, when the Peshwas,
whose motherland was the Konkan, took control of the Maratha campaign, they took
a personal interest in a establishing control of the region and in 1737 launched
a blitzkrieg with the support of disgruntled locals, frustrated by the religious
repression of hindusim and by 1739, after a siege of Bassien which was
heroically defended by the Portuguese, they were victorious.
