title: Gujerat
---

Portuguse-Gujerat interactions cover three distinct periods. Initially, when
the Portuguese were struggling to find a foothold in the South, the Zamorin in
Calicut formed an alliance with the more powerful Gujerat Sultanate which sent
contingents, both naval and land based forces, in support. Once the Portuguese
had fought back these assaults, Gujerat was forced on to the defensive by the
far superior Portuguese naval forces and though they were strongly supported
internationally, initially by the Fatimid Rulers in Egypt and then by the
Ottoman Empire which replaced the Fatimid's, the Portuguese had the upper hand
and Gujerat wasn fighting a losing battle. When Hjmayub attacked Gujerat IN 15NN
THE Sultan Bahdur decided tht the Mughals were the more dangerous enemy and made
peace with the Portuguese in 1534. However when Humayun had to withdraw from the
scene Bahadur once again commenced hostilities which continued till 1548 when
Bahadur died under somewhat mysterious circumstances while boarding a
Poortuguese flagship for talks with the Portuguese commander. After that,
Gujerat could only be of nuisance value to the Portuguese who slowly
consolidated their position in the Konkan.
