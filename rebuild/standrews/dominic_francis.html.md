The St. Dominic St and St. Francis Rd

The \'I\' community of our parish is located on the roads of St. Dominic
and St. Francis.Â  The Patron is St. Dominic. This community consists of

The Rosary was recited from Monday to Friday during the month of
October. On the last day, we had a get together, which was attended by
about 45 people.

On December 22nd, children aged 6 - 11 from the community went Carol
