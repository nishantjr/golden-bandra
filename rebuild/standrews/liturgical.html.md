The Liturgical Group is 20 years old and comprises of 8-10 members. It
meets every alternate Monday from 6:30 p.m. onwards. If a member/members
are unable to attend, the group is informed and a prayer is said. The
member who has prepared the liturgy requests someone to read from the
Missal. This goes on till the Gospel and the introductions are read,
corrected and passed. The same holds for the Prayer of the Faithful.

The liturgy is prepared for all the Sundays and Feast days. We work
under the guidance of the Spiritual Director, presently Fr. Serrao.

A schedule is drawn up, posted on the Notice Board near the Sacristy,
giving the names of members who have agreed to write the liturgy and
when id has to be presented.
