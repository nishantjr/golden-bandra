The women's cell of St. Andrew's Church was formed on the 9^th^ of March
2003 as per the directives laid down by the Synod.

The objectives of this cell are as follows:

\

To create an awareness among women about their rights and also the fact
that they do not have to tolerate abuse in any form.

To create awareness that a women is not alone in her trials. The Women's
Cell is her support group. To substantiate this, the Cell has doctors,
counselors and lawyers, whose expertise can be called upon should the
need arise.

To help women empower themselves to be financially self-sufficient.

\

The cell meets regularly on the first and third Tuesday of every month
at 7:30 p.m. In room No. 4 (which is the C.C.O. Office).
