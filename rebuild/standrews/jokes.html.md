**We\'re putting together humorous content from various sources.\
We welcome contributions that have an authentic local flavour.\
There\'s a lot of funny stuff going on in our Parish we\'re sure \...
some of which could actually be humorous, so if you know of any that
could be posted on this page, please send it to us. Equally, if any of
our parishioners feels like contributing sketches or drawings we\'d also
like that.**

**These are supposedly ACTUAL announcements from ACTUAL church
bulletins.**

From an old, old, Andrean Notes: We are pleased to announce the birth of
David Alan Jesao Fernandes, the sin of Mr and Mrs J.A.P. Fernandes.

Don\'t let worry kill you - let the church help.

Remember in prayer the many who are sick of our church and community.

This afternoon there will be a meeting in the South and North ends of
the church. Children will be baptized at both ends.

Tuesday at 4:00 PM there will be an ice cream social. All ladies giving
milk will please come early.

Wednesday the ladies liturgy will meet. Mrs. Pereira will sing \"Put me
in my little bed\" accompanied by the Choir Master.

Thursday at 5:00 PM there will be a meeting of the Little Mothers Club.
All ladies wishing to be \"Little Mothers\" will meet with the Pastor in
his study.

This being Easter Sunday, we will ask Mrs. Lewis to come forward and lay
an egg on the altar.
