There are 24 families in this close knit community and till today the
sense of closeness is more than merely physical. Each neighbour is aware
of happenings in the area and equally willing to help and get involved.

This is a very close knit community and residents remember the days when
life was more relaxed and people spent long hours each day lounging in
their \'oatlas\' and chatting with passing friends - rather than rushing
from appointment to meeting, or sprawled indoors in front of TV sets or
computers.

The small, 50 x 50 ft square is used for community Masses and functions.
Housie is often conducted by the youth who also set up a community crib
in a corner of the Agna Square, each December.
