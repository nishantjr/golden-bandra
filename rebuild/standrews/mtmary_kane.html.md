consisting of approximately 70 families. The zonal core group meetings
are attended by between 5-8 members.\

The rosary was held at various venues to increase participation. On the
last day the Rosary was held at the Room behind Mt.Mary church. All the
venues were very well attended and the idea appreciated. This fostered
communitarian togetherness. The traditional boiled grams and cold drinks
were served on the last day. Apart from this the core group has also
reached out to the sick and aged of the community from time to time.\

We had no programme in this month but visited the house bound and sick &
elderly members of our community. Since this was also the month of the
'Celebrate Bandra' therefore all members were attending the cultural
programmes organised.\

We decided to go carol singing this year as no groups had come to our
community in the last 4 years. Despite the usual ups & downs we managed
to get a group together and went carol singing on Dec.22nd special
metion needs to be made that Maria with her beautiful voice and Ashwin
Rodrigues accompanied on guitar despite his busy schedule. We were
showered with a lot of praise, cakes, sweets and money which was not our
intention. Though we did manage to spread a lot of good cheer in the
season to be merry.\

We visited the home bound sick and a member who had recently lost her
husband. The money we collected from the carol singing was used to buy
small gifts for them. This gesture was appreciated and welcomed by those
whose lives we had touched. By all this we were able to spread the love,
peace and joy of the Baby Jesus.
