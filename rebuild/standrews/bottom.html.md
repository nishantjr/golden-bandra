St.Andrew\'s, the oldest existing church in Bandra, was built by the
Portuguese around the year 1600 on the shores of the Arabian Sea. Its
massive masonary walls support a gabled, tiled roof topped by a Cross
rising 58 feet into the skies above. This Cross was once a dominant and
familiar landmark on Bandra\'s skyline, though, in today\'s highrise
Bandra the Church is dwarfed by the surrounding buildings. Nevertheless,
St Andrew\'s Parish continues to foster a vibrant community and strives
to provide an environment for the spiritual and overall growth of its
members. This website is a part of that endeavour.

The website has at least three \'reasons for being\'.\
\
1. The site provides valuable background, historical and archival
information about our venerable institution.\
\
2. It intends to keep parishioners informed about current events in the
many happening areas of the parish - activities in the 23 SCC locations,
the cells and organisations, events organised weekly by the
Communication Group, feasts and special events like the Parish Zonal
Competitions.\
\
3. Perhaps the more important reason for the site is that it affords a
medium for interaction between the members of the parish community, to
foster and enhance the live sense of community and kinship that Bandra
and St Andrew\'s value so much.\
The Andrean Web Team invites involvement and hopes that our parishioners
will actively participate in the website and help to shape and maintain
it.
