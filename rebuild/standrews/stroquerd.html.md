[[November 2003]{.underline}[ -- Rosaries and masses offered for the
souls of our deceased members, relatives on the 1^st^ and 2^nd^
November. Childrens\'s Day was celebrated on 14^th^ November. Since
there are very few children and youth in this community, grandchildren
were also welcomed. The children had an enjoyable evening playing games,
participating in the colouring competitions, among other things.
Contirbutions came in from several memebers of the community wi9th
regards to gifts, prizes and refreshments. The animators also made a
spontaneous appearance at the house of a couple who was celebrating
their ruby anniversary in a very subdued manner. They were delighted
that we remebered and our greetings were much appreciated. Several other
birthdays, anniversaries were also remebered and animators wished those
involved, making them feel touched and more important by the part of the
community, a sense of belonging.
