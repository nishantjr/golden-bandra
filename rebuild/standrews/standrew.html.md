Andrew, like his brother Simon Peter, was a fisherman. He became a
disciple of the great St. John the Baptist, but when John pointed to
Jesus and said, \"Behold the Lamb of God!\" Andrew understood that Jesus
was greater. At once he left John to follow the Divine Master. Jesus
knew that Andrew was walking behind him, and turning back, he asked,
\"what do you seek?\" When Andrew answered that he would like to know
where Jesus lived, Our Lord replied, \"Come and see.\" Andrew had been
only a little time with Jesus when he realized that this was truly the
Messiah.\

From then on, he chose to follow Jesus. Andrew was thus the first
disciple of Christ. Next, Andrew brought his brother Simon (St. Peter)
to Jesus and Jesus received him, too, as His disciple. At first the two
brothers continued to carry on their fishing trade and family affairs,
but later, the Lord called them to stay with Him all the time. He
promised to make them fishers of men, and this time, they left their
nets for good. It is believed that after Our Lord ascended into Heaven,
St. Andrew went to Greece to preach the gospel. He is said to have been
put to death on a cross, to which he was tied, not nailed. He lived two
days in that state of suffering, still preaching to the people who
gathered around their beloved Apostle. Two countries have chosen St.
Andrew as their patron - Russia and Scotland.
