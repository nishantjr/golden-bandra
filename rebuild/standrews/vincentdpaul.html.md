The Society of St. Vincent de Paul came to India in 1863.  In Bandra,
St. Peter\'s Conference is one of the oldest, followed by St. Anne\'s in
1867. Some of St. Andrew\'s parishioners were members of these
Conferences.  It was only in 1971 that St Andrew decided to start its
own unit.  The first meeting was held on July 16, with Br. Albert
Rodrigues as the President. One of our members, Sr. Lovey Pereira, who
was present at that first meeting, is still an active member today.  Br.
Stanny Fernandes attended the first meeting as the Vice President and
representative of St. Andrew\'s Conference, but old age and ill-health
prevent him from doing much now. The SVP has several adopted families
and help several more with educational and medical expenses.  We
believe, \"No work of charity is foreign to the Society\".
