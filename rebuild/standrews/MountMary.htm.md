# Our Lady of The Mount 

Ever since the air of Galilee thrilled to the exultant strains of Mary's
Magnificat\..."\...and behold from henceforth all generations shall call
me blessed!" Mary's prophecy has found glorious fulfilment during the
centuries in every age and in every time.\
The brush, the organ and the pen have all laid their treasures at her
feet. Art has found its highest inspiration in the "Madonna and Child" a
theme that has set aglow the canvasses of Murillo, Raphael and Fra
Angelico with a heavenly radiance. Organ notes have swelled to heights
of devotional sublimity in the Ave Maria of Schubert and Gounod. Shrines
and spired cathedrals have risen in every land in homage to her name,
adorning the smiling planes or surfbeaten shores fringed with feathery
palm, crowning the verdant hilltops or peeping through the foliage of
wooded dales: Lourdes in France, Loreto in Italy, Pilar in Spain, Fatima
in Portugal, Guadeloupe in Mexico and Mount Mary in India. \
F. H. Gracias.

\
Crowning a verdant hilltop and overlooking the sea, the belfried towers
of the shrine are a familiar landmark to all who cross the dividing
waters between Bombay and its suburbs. To the traveller on his way to
his daily tasks in the city at dawn, or to the weary worker returning
home at dusk, the twin spires of Mount Mary's spectral white against the
mists of the morning, or sharply silhouetted against the sunset colours,
are a call to prayer. An "Angelus" in stone. \
The gypsy sun is setting, lo an ark Sails serenely on the evening tide.
An "AVE ! " wells from all her crew. Abide, Dear Mother; to the happy
paean hark. Accept this garland of our loves-a mark Of thankful hearts.
To thee we confide This little bark. And stoutly did she ride The loud
outrageous gale and tempest dark. R.A. Pires. \

# The Hermitage on the Hill

It all started over four hundred years ago, when Bandra was just a few
scattered villages\...\
In the middle of the year 1566 two priests made their way to the top of
the Mount. There they built a small chapel in honour of Our Lady.\
Today it is the focal point of universal homage to Mary, the cradle of
Christianity in Bandra, visited throughout the year by a vast concourse
of people of every caste, creed and community.\
Bandra-today the proud queen of Bombay's suburbs -is situated on the
S.W. end of the Island of Salsette, separated from the Island of Bombay
by a creek, which\
now is known as Mahim-Creek. The island derives its name from Shshasti
i.e. Sixty-six or the number of villages\
of which it was originally composed, before the Portuguese took it.\
In 1568 the villages of Bandra (Wanara) and Kurla (Colorem) were
transferred to the Jesuit Fathers. Besides, they were given full rights
over the waters of the creek, then called Bandra Creek.\
With the passing of Bandra into Jesuit hands, the stage was set for the
birth of christianity in Bandra. The \
election of the first shrine must be placed somewhere between 1568 and
1570.\
In a letter anno 1575 from the Jesuit Rector of Bassein it is said: "The
village of Bandra is progressing. The Jesuits are on top of the hill and
live in a fort." This was a postulate of personal safety since in those
days pirates, "Moors and Malabarians" infested these shares.\
It is a matter of conjecture which "fort" is meant. The famous Castella
de Aguada or Fort of the Waterpoint was built much later, viz. in 1640.
This fort guarded Bandra's Waterpoint-now known as Land-End or
BandraPoint-, because it was the place where ships stopped to take in
water. Simultaneously it also commanded the entrance to Bandra Creek.
Or: had there been some fortifications or guardhouse before already? Had
perhaps the very " hermitage" on the Mount been fortified in the manner
of Saint Anne's Church-cum-school on the site of the-now
former-slaughterhouse, and of St. Andrew's Church, close to the Mount? \
According to another letter, written only two months later in the same
year, the establishment housed already three priests and their number
had even been increased by incoming guests. There was also a boarding
school where sixty students received education "just as those in
Bassein". St. Anne's had been built after 1577, and St. Andrew's in
1583.\
Be this as it may, the fact is that in 1583 nearly the whole of
Bandra-no more than six thousand odd in those days:-had come into the
catholic fold. In 1940 the "hermitage" was enlarged into a chapel. That
same year also the fort was built.-Now the chapel could also serve the
Portuguese garrison manning the fort. \

# Mother on the Mount

In a Jesuit report of 1669 we read that-surprisingly though it may
sound-" The hermitage of Our Lady of the Mount depended on the church of
Saint Anne". That the parish priest went there once a week "to say Mass
for the people who flock there in great numbers out of devotion to their
holy Mother". That the feast of the shrine was celebrated each year on
the 8th September, the feast of the Nativity of Our Lady.\
This is the first time that history makes mention of the fact that the
Mount had become a place of pilgrimage in honour of Our Lady. This
evidently implies the presence of a statue. It appears to be of foreign
wood carving. The Infant Jesus is being held on the palm of the right
hand. The left hand holds an orb and lily.\
From a later document it appears that the chapel had to be enlarged or
even rebuilt "by the Portuguese and was named Capella de Nossa Senhora
de Monte, which was made a filial of the ancient church of Saint Anne.
This happened in 1678. A Jesuit letter referring to the years 1679-87
tells us that the shrine of N.S. de Monte was already famous as a place
of pilgrimage and was much frequented by christians and non-christians
alike.\
A remarkable story is told of what happened round the turn of the
17th-18th century.\
Bandra was invaded by a pirate army of the Muscat Arabs who, hoping to
find treasure, attempted to ransack the shrine. When disappointed in
their expectations, they planned to set fire to the chapel. For this
they went to fetch much wood. It was then that a huge army of angry bees
attacked them, forcing them to abandon their evil designs. It is said
that they even left in such a hurry that they were forced to abandon
their arms too.\
The year 1739 brought about a radical change. It was the year of the
Maratha uprising.\
Because of their strategical positions, both the Mount Mary Shrine as
also the church of Saint Anne were dynamited by the. Portuguese, at the
request of the English, who were on the other side of the creek.\
The image was ferried across the creek in a fishing craft for safe
custody in Saint Michael's church at Mahim. Mahim was on the English
side. There it remained till 1761, the year of the defeat of the
Marathas in the battle of Panipat, when it was carried on a decorated
float in a solemn procession back across the creek, to be reinstalled in
the rebuilt chapel on the Mount. From then onwards Mount Mary's chapel
came under the tutelage of the vicar of St. Andrew's.\
When after the Maratha uprising, priests and people fled, they carried
with them the cult of "Nossa Senhora de Monte". It seems that even up to
this day her feast is kept up with great eclat in some parts of Goa and
in Mangalore. In the latter place it is known as "Montichem Feste".
Bombay emigrants have carried the feast even to far-off Canada.\
No spectacular miracles have marked the shrine out for world fame, but
the vast concourse of devotees of all castes and creeds who throng to
the shrine with their offerings in tens of thousands during the festival
in September, and in a continuous stream throughout the year, is ample
testimony of the efficacy of Our Lady's help and protection.
Non-christians call her affectionately "Moti Mauli" or "Mothu Mauli",
Mother of Pearls or else "Monte Mauli", Mother on the Mount.\

# The Grateful Parsi Baronet

It is little known perhaps, that in the beginning of the 19th century
two famous non-christian Bombayites have been the recipients of a
special favour and that, as a result thereof, the first Causeway was
built, linking Bandra with Mahim. These recipients and builders were the
Parsi baronet Sir Jamshetjee Jeejeebhoy-popularly known as Batliwala-and
Lady Jamshetjee.\
Endowed with ample prosperity Sir Jamshetjee and lady Jamshetjee had
three sons. They were distressed, however, that none of their female
children lived more than three years. They mentioned this fact to Sir
Roger Faria, a leading Bombay merchant. At that time Sir Jamshetjee was
still a partner in Sir Roger's firm, but took over as director after Sir
Roger's death.\
Both Sir Roger and his daughter Donna Margarida suggested to Jamshetjee
and his wife to make a vow to Our Lady of the Mount, promising that if
another girl were born and would survive the age of seven, they would
build a causeway linking Mahim with Bandra. The baronet hesitated, but
Donna Margarida referred to some of the miracles wrought through the
intercession of Our Lady of the Mount, and to the devotion to her of
thousands of christians and non-christians alike. She also pointed out
the great utility of such a vow in view of the great inconvenience
caused to numerous pilgrims, who in the rainy season had to cross the
creek in frail boats in order to attend the feast in the beginning of
September. \
Impressed by her account Sir Jamshetjee requested Margarida to make the
vow herself on his behalf. The vow was written on a piece of paper and
deposited by her at the feet of Our Lady.\
A girl was born, namely Lady Phirozbaj. The vow was renewed annually
till she reached the age of seven. When she entered her eighth year
Margarida reminded Sir Jamshetjee of his vow, and the grateful father
not only built the Causeway, but also the flight of steps between the
foot of the northern flank of the Mount and the chapel -now church-on
top. They are known as the Bomonjee steps.- A tablet indicates the year
1879.\
Of all the members of the Baronet's family, Lady Phirozbaj alone lived
to be seventy-two.\

# The Basilica - \"Angelus in Stone\"

The fourth and latest innovation of the shrine was made in 1904: the
year which happily marked the golden jubilee of the Declaration of the
Immaculate Conception on 8th December 1854 by Pope Pius IX.\
The church with its noble facade and soaring spires is, except for the
inner-sanctuary which is modelled after the Roman fashion, a fine
example of neo-Gothic architecture. It is also a familiar landmark.
Inside, the murals, depicting the life of Our Lady, have been executed
in Indian style of the Bombay artist G. P. Fernandes.-Very aptly some
one has called this heart raising edifice an "Angelus in stone".\
In 1954, the year of the National Marian Congress held in Bombay to
celebrate the centenary of the Declaration, His Holiness Pope Pius XII
raised the shrine to the dignity of a Minor Basilica.-This often happens
if a church becomes famous for attracting large crowds of pilgrims. The
word "basilica" is of Eastern origin, signifying a palace or a royal
hall for holding meetings. Special spiritual privileges are granted to
priests and visitors, and to the church Insignia. These are a mace, a
special bell and a richly decorated umbrella. They will be carried in
procession when the bishop of the diocese makes his formal entity into
the church. On the very day the church received these insignia, viz. on
the 8th September, feast of the Nativity of Our Lady, the statue was
also solemnly crowned by His Eminence Cardinal Gracias.\
The same year also, across the road and in front of the church a
magnificent Oratory was built in honour of Our Lady of Fatima, to
commemorate the Marian Congress, which was held from the 4th till the
8th December.\
On the evening of the 5th the inauguration of the Oratory was performed
by His Eminence the Papal Legate. Because of the persons participating
and the nature of the functions this event may be called the most
"Marian" one of the entire Marian Congress.\
Bishop Raymond of Allahabad-the late Archbishop of Nagpur-preached. He
eloquently dwelt on Mary's motherhood as the ideal of India's women, and
showed how the mother of God alone could satisfy their yearnings.
Shortly after, Valerian Cardinal Gracias, the papal legate, placed a
golden crown on the head of the infant Jesus and another one on the head
of Our Lady. 'There was an outburst of applause from the multitude,
while from the belfry the bells gave out a joyous peal.\
The concluding service on 8th December at 5.30 p.m. culminated in a
mammoth procession proceeding from Cross Maidan. The largest, the most
orderly and the most reverent Bombay has ever witnessed. It must have
consisted of over 100,000 people, and certainly not exclusively
catholics. In it was carried the statue of Our Lady of the Mount.
Borrowing from the bible's Book of Revelation ' a great multitude past
all counting, taken from all peoples and languages" of India "cried
blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honour and power and
strength through endless ages to God" and his immaculate mother.\

# The Highest Honour

Concluding our walk through history, the year 1964 brought the highest
honour to the shrine: the visit of the Supreme Pontiff Pope Paul VI.\
The Holy Father's visit to India had been occasioned by the 38th
International Eucharistic Congress held in Bombay that year.\
It was Saturday 5th December:- Tremendous excitement that day in Bandra!
A two-mile canopy composed of festoons and garlands, of countless
banners and coloured buntings proclaiming "Long live the Pope" covered
the entire stretch of road up to the Mount.\
On his arrival at 9.10 the Pontiff looked up at the facade of the
edifice and then entered.-Going up to the High Altar where Our Lady is
enshrined, he prayed for a few minutes. He too had come as a pilgrim, in
line with the countless others who for centuries had made their ascent.
He then made a short speech in which he hailed Mary as the Mother of
India and the Mother of the Church. In conclusion he saluted her with
the "Hail Mary, full of grace---" in which the entire congregation
joined their Supreme Pastor.-After this, the Holy Father gave gifts to
the shrine and to its prelate-pastor Bishop Longinus Pereira.\
From a rostrum outside the church, from which he faced not only the vast
multitude that filled the compound and the road in front of the
basilica, but also the oratory where the Fatima statue is erected, he
addressed the people.\
The words of His Holiness contained a supplication to Christ, the King
of Peace, for peace in the world. But the warning of Fatima about a
threatening catastrophy unless mankind would resort to more Prayer,
Penance and Meditation could be clearly heard in the second half of the
speech. The Holy Father ended his address by saying: "May God bring to
naught the designs of pride, of violence and despotism: May he rather
inspire thoughts of peace in all: the statesmen and military commanders,
those who influence public opinion; all peoples and their rulers."\
His Holiness had spent about twenty minutes at the Mount.\

# The Annual Fair Today

Once every year, during eight days from the feast of the Nativity of Our
Lady ( 8 Sept. ), the giant wheels turn. If the 8th September does not
fall on a Sunday, it is the Sunday following, which will mark the
beginning of the feast.-It is proceeded by a Novena of morning and
evening devotions in the Basilica.\
The young and the not-so-young rise in giant wheels to dizzying heights
to be brought down to earth again with a lurch; scampering about in
others, jumping from trotting horses to galloping ones, or are swung
around in little boats swimming through the air as though it were the
sea. \
Motorcycles splutter across the Well of Death. Low rumbling moans that
accord ill with the whining of the great wheels, are emitted from the
dusty stalls built out of gunny-bags, where optical illusions deceive
the viewer that he is seeing such freaks of nature as snake-women and
mermaids.\
In garishly decorated shamianas the music plays, partners change tables,
and the voice of the compere announces the trumps.\
Prom the top of the hill down the hundred and thirty eight steps on the
East flank, merging into Chapel Road, and the Bomonjee steps leading to
the road that goes to the station, the crowds surge backwards and
forwards, jostling, pushing, edging their way from the shops that sell
religious articles and from the stalls put up by the toyshops -which
today rarely sell as good articles as they sold thirty years ago-, from
the toyshops to the sweetmeat shops, from the sweetmeat shops to the
restaurants that sell some brightly-coloured soft drinks, and from there
to the hastily built photographers' studios which can give you your
photograph in three poses for a rupee or so within a few minutes.\
But, whatever the outward circumstances, there can be no misleading the
genuineness and the fervour of the devotion to Our Lady of the Mount.\
The hands that are lifted, the eyes that are raised to the beautiful
statue on the altar of the church, are the hands and eyes of men and
women, who believe that the lovely Lady will be good to them and come to
their aid in their affliction. From all parts of the country they have
come; wave upon wave. Hindus, Christians, Parsees, Muslims,
Maharashtrians, Gujaratis and Fisher folk in their different sarees and
costumes. \
Climbing the hill from the northern side, they collect candles from the
stalls, "sixfooters" even, for "fullsize" gratitude. These stalls line
Mount Mary Road, right up to the door of the Church. Many also buy the
waxen images of parts of the human body-ear, eye, throat, chest, breast
or abdomen-according to the favours they want granted. "Any brains"? I
asked a bit cynically. "We have no brains", was the simple reply. This
part of the shopping over they take their place in the never-ending
queues behind the barricades, finally entering the sanctuary where they
kneel or stand for a few- brief moments before the statue of Our Lady,
deposit their offerings at her feet and are gone, giving place to others
and others-and-the many others following behind. Many times it can be
observed how parents place their babies at Mary's feet for a few
moments, whilst others lift them up on their outstretched arms in total
surrender. In this manner they hope to secure the Mother's special
protection. Some parents also, with the same idea in mind, save their
child registered as "cattiva"-the Portuguese word for "captive"-for a
certain number of years. An offering is made on the occasion. When the
period of "captivity" is over, some will return to the shrine to
"redeem" the child, and a second offering is made. A special
red-yellow-green cord, blessed by the priest and touched to the feet of
the statue, is most popular, even today. Since the cord is worn round
the neck without a medal attached, it would seem to be related to the
captivity idea. \
Occasionally also parents bring a child to the priest for "tonsure".
They had vowed not to have the child's hair cut before a certain favour
had been obtained. It clearly is a Nazarean custom. \
It is estimated that during the feast upwards of 150,000 pilgrims and
visitors make their way to the shrine a love rendezvous of all creeds,
presenting the highest degree of communal concord. \
Unless the great trust and confidence shown by the people has been
generously answered over years md centuries, the devotion to Our Lady of
the Mount remains a puzzle. \

# A Hundred years ago - The Bombardier 

An interesting intermezzo concerning the nine devotional days, preceding
the external celebration of the feast, turns the clock of time hundred
years back. \
It was a celebration simply known as Fama, the Portuguese word for
"fame", but now connoting "Rejoicing". It began on the first day of the
Novena. \
It was a very significant day for the people of Bandra, as then the
fisherfolk of old used to hold a grand carnival, a demonstration very
unique and witnessed by thousands of all caste and creed. The scene of
the merriment embraced the whole of Colwad, a village clustered round
Chapel Rd., as the road is called which leads to the "chapel" on the
Mount across the Eastern flank of the hill. \
Men masked as warriors, giants, dancers and boatmen paraded the streets
in palanquins, in boats and vehicles gaily decorated and illuminated.
Clapper-dancers dancing round their flagbearers to the exciting rhythm
of the tomtom drums and accompanied by reed-pipers. Masked men, with
belts of bells round their waist and necks, treaded dynamically with
long strides to the 'glong-glong" sound of their bells, merrily mixing
with the other masqueraders. The long procession, making a halt here and
there, passed through the crowded and narrow streets, full of lite and
gaity in honour of their Lady and protectress: the Moti Mauli of the
Mount.\
During the days of the novena itself the faithful were piped down and
"tom-tommed" off their cots at cock's crow time. Then, at the
Angelus-6.30-the "bombardino" swung into action. From the hill's East
flank he boomed salvos from two muzzle-loader cannons. One barrel is
still lying on the top-left of the ascending steps. The boom of their
"big brothers" was followed by the bark of smaller mortars which would
bring the last of the long-sleepers on their feet.\
Then, armed with hurricane lanterns and candlelights, the faithful would
traverse the narrow paths from the village through the density of
thickets, rice-fields and other plantations to the foot of the hill.
Here and there, along Chapel Road, the spooky light of flickering
kerosene streetlights and the feeble tint of a smoker's "bidi" would
reveal the walker's or squatter's identity. To scare away frogs and
reptiles, walking sticks with tiny bells at the knobs were used.

\
"Those were the days!", the wise old man remarked, who told me all this,
"but \
Gone are the days! \
As our elders used to say. \
Gone are the folks \
Who put us on our way!" \
"In our days the bombardier would be put into the 'cooler'.
Police-licences would be needed. And where are the fresh rice-fields for
making the special sweets and other special culinary delicacies which
were reserved for those days? The Varas and Polas, the Pan-Botris and
Pan-Polis, the Atolas and Sandnas: all of them prepared with fresh paddy
and other ingredients, some of them baked between turmeric leaves .
Delicacies, hardly remembered today- "\
Here the old man walked away.\
This also brings our own walk through history and the discourse on
"Monte Mauli", the Mother on the Mount, to an end.\
As in ages past, God, through his Blessed Mother with her outstretched
hand will, at the very least, continue to ease mental stress and bring
peace to the mind, however physically ravaged the pilgrim.\
If miracles do not happen at once, there is no blinking the fact that
faith can work miracles, even today.\
We come from North, South, East and West \
For thee, a mighty throng \
To give thee India's richest, best: \
To sing thee India's song. \
Her longings for the Truth divine, \
Their slaking still await. \
The Way, the Truth, the Life is thine \
For her, Immaculate!\
