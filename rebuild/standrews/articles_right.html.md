We welcome articles from parishioners and people connected with St
Andrew's Parish. These can be any appropriate articles of interest to
the Parish, - preferably connected with people, matters and events in
the parish. We would very much like you to permit us to mention your
name along with the articles. For various reasons we cannot post
articles \'live\' but will do so as rapidly as we can. In the event that
the WebTeam feels that there is need for editing material contributed we
will do so, keeping in mind that the content substance should remain
intact.
