Community consists of 80 families and its patron is the Holy Trinity.\

During the month of Ocotber, we recited the Rosary everyday in Blue Bell
where our non-Catholic bretheren came daily to pray as well. Their
intentions were also prayed for. We had a small fellowship on the last
day of the month, where everyone brought something making it enjoyable.
Some families also took part in the Rosary pilgrimage to the Mount and
also attended the closing ceremony at St. Stanislaus.\

With the preparation for Christmas, it was decided to defer our annual
thanksgiving / get-together to January 2004.
