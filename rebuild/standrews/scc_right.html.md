Small Christian Communities (SCC) Started in 1985 as the Basic Christian
Communites, the SCCs today are a vital parish and community activity.
The Parish is sectioned into 23 different groups location wise, each
designated by letters of the alphabet. (See the table below the Map of
all SCCs) This website will post information about ongoing activities in
the individual SCCs.
