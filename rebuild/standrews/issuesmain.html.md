### ISSUES

In any parish there are always matters on which different people have
different opinions. This page offers several topics about which we
invite discussion. Your suggestions can make a difference so please let
us know what you feel and why.\
\
Send us your views on any of the topics mentioned in the column on the
left of this page.\
\
We would very much like you to [permit us to mention your name along
with the views expressed.]{.underline}\
\
For various reasons we cannot post opinions \'live\' but will do so as
rapidly as we can. In the event that the WebTeam feels that there is
need for editing material contributed we will do so, keeping in mind
that the content substance should remain intact.
