This began as the \'Ways and Means Committe\' founded by Fr Henry
Remedios in June 1950. The responsibilities of this committee are to
allocate and oversee the various expenditures for routine and special
projects. The recent renovation and major repairs conducted on the Bosco
Hall building is an example of the work sanctioned by the Committee. The
Finance committee consists of Joe Pereira, Ms.Charmaine Barretto, Ernest
Fernandes and Henry D\\\'Souza.Of course the Head as always is the
Parish Priest (Rev. Fr Vernon Aguiar).
