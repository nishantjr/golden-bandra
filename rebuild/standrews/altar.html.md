Down the years the Altar Servers have provided dedicated service during
the various church services. This group reached special heights under
the patronage of Mgr George Fernandes starting in the 1960s. He
reorganised the group and moulded them into a superbly disciplined and
trained sodality.

Regular meetings, practice sessions and strict schedules ensured that
the Altar Servers were looked on as a select group to which all young
parish boys aspired. Later the membership was opened to girls too and
today they continue their service to the parish.
