The Bosco Hall is perhaps synonomous with the Bosco Club, the
organisation formed under the vicarship of Fr V. Dyer in 1944. The
initial focus was to provide an environment to promote recreational
activity for the parish youth. The building adjacent to the church had
just been vacated by the girls section of St Andrew\'s High School and
the upper floor was allocated to house the Bosco Club. From sports
activities the focus included social and literary activities. One
activity that the Bosco Club can view with justifiable pride today is
the Andrean Talent Contest, or Zonals. This annual activity has helped
foster the awesome talent in our parish that year after year, Â through
more than five decades has thrown up professional musical and dramatic
performances that has entertained thousand of people from our parish and
from all over the city. The Bosco Club continues to foster various
talents and groups today, and as in the case of the Zonals, the
organisational skills fostered in the process have proved to be as vital
a gain as the activities organised themselves. Today the Bosco Club
activities are handled by the Communication Cell under Fr Adrian
Phillips.\
