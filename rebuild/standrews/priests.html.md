had an inclination to the join the priesthood from a very young age. He
joined the priesthood at 18 years and was ordained in 1967.

He has had many memorable and enriching experiences over the past years.
He has been a principal of various schools in the past 22 years since
1976. He was appointed a parish priest in 1987 for the first time.

As the current parish priest his vision for St.Andrews is to make the
parish as vibrant as possible in reaching out to each and every person.

A resident of Bandra itself, was originally from Mt.Carmel\'s parish and
did his schooling from St.Stanislaus High School. He joined the
priesthood at a very young age of 16 years !! way back in 1953. He
always wanted to become a priest.

He was the principal in 11 schools, a fact few of us are aware of. A
very memorable and great achievement for him would be \"Sacred Heart
School- Worli\" where he completely transformed and brought up the
school. He has enjoyed being the Sports Administrator of the Bombay
Schools for around 27 years. He also had the great honour of being the
secretary to the 1^st^ Bishop of Baroda.

His vision for St.Andrews would be for the parishioners to patronize the
parish school (i.e.St.Andrew\'s High School) to a larger extent. He
would also like to democratize the school by having different
communities in the school.

He is originally from Nalasopara, St.Gonsalo Gracia Parish, Ghas
(Vasai). He too joined the priesthood at an incredibly young age of
17years in 1962. He always longed to be a priest. In fact in Std. 10 he
went for a retreat and made up his mind thereafter. Fr. Prasad is also
very talented. He is known for his writing skills. He has released a
book \"Hasan Amhi Hasuya\" which contains 1100 jokes and a similar book
in English with around 600 jokes. Absolutely amazing !!! the Bishop too
has read his works.

He has also translated the \"Legion of Mary\" leaflet into Marathi which
will be released shortly. He also has other talents like acting,
singing, and music. For him a great achievement was in 1981 at
Kanjurmarg where 2 more floors of the school needed to be built. To
raise the funds for the same, a parade called \"Tabassum Hit Parade\"
was held at Shamukhananda Hall where the chief guest was the famous
Mr.Amitabh Bachan. This experience has been an unforgettable one. He has
also been a parish priest for 16 years in various parishes across the
city.

His vision for St.Andrew\'s is mainly directed towards the Marathi
speaking parishioners for their growth both mentally & spiritually.

He is originally from \"St.Anthony\'s\" parish, Vakola. He had joined
the priesthood at a young age of 20 years. He has been in the priesthood
for an incredibly long 50 years. Some of you may not be aware that he
had served in our parish years ago from 1978-1981 as Parish Priest.
It\'s great to have him back. He has been active with the \"Alcoholics
Anonymous Group\"(AA Group). In fact he has had some very touching and
unforgettable moments and experiences with this group which is also
special for those who attend. One such moment was at a recent meeting
held no May 25, 2004 at the A.A.Group (Irla) where they have thanked him
and mentioned how grateful they are. What an unforgettable experience
that was !!

His main aim and vision for St.Andrew\'s is to consolidate the
communities and to soon have the confidence to function as ONE BIG
Family.

Originally from Mangalore - Paladka, St.Ignatius Parish. He too joined
at a very young age. Right after his SSC he joined the SVD Congregation.
He has been around the country as he studied in Madhya Pradesh and was
ordained in 1964 in Pune. He worked for 20 years in the \"Formation
House\" at Pune, Goa & Mangalore and finally came to Bombay in 1987 at
St.Theresa\'s Parish, Bandra. Both his experiences at Formation House
and Pastoral work have been very different. Pastoral work helped to
enrich him and he has found great bliss in it. He had always wanted to
be a priest. Currently he looks after the Konkani speaking parishioners.

His vision is to improve family life where he would like to stress on
the religious as well as social aspect. Since the family is the Basic
Unit, this is the need of the hour otherwise many families would break
up.

He was originally a parishioner of St.Theresa\'s (Girgaum). He was
ordained very recently on June 9, 2002 and has been in the priesthood
for 2 years. He is as vibrant and lively as ever. Known for his way with
the Youth of our parish. He is an absolute people\'s person. What we
don\'t know is that he had other ambitions when young or should I say
younger. He had wanted to be in the INA (Indian National Army) -
Surprised? But which ever way he still serves the people if not the
country. He has also studied Law while in the Seminary. While studying
at the Seminary he also went to Raigad and stayed & worked in the
various villages that dot the landscape. He is an \'Action Man\' always
on the move. He not only has a way with people but also has a way with
words. He knows how to lift you up when you are feeling low.

His vision for the parish is that it should take the lead in
transforming society.
