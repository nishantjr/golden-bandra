**The Andrean Youth Movement (AYM)**

The youth of our parish have formed a youth group entitled the Andrean
Youth Movement or the AYM. The AYM consists of about 30 members and
meets every Sunday after the 9:30 am mass. The meetings are held on the
ground floor of the Bosco Hall. The AYM is active in many areas and is a
very dynamic group. Julyn Rodrigues is the president of the AYM.

 

The AYM has 3 main spheres on which programmes are based. These are (i)
Formation (ii) Fellowship and (iii) Service. Earlier the group used to
focus equally on all three areas; however, lately they intend to shift
the focus more towards service. This means that they will take part in
and organise more service-oriented programmes. Some such programmes
include the street children programme, the crèche and the various
activities of the parish. Most of these programmes will start in July.
There are many more events on the cards.

 

Apart from this, the AYM is in charge of putting together and editing
the \'Y-Files\', the youth page of our parish bulletin, [[The Andrean
Notes]{.underline}](andreanNotes.html) . They also put up the crib in
church at Christmas. They also conduct paper drives, the proceeds of
which go towards their activities.
