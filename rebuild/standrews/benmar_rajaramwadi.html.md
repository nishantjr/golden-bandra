The \'O\' community of our parish is located at Benmar and Rajaram Wadi.
There are 83 families residing here. The patron of this community is St.
Maria Goretti.

\

The community Rosary was recited at 8 different locations on Tuesdays
and Fridays during the month of October.

We conducted a Prayer Service for the Rite of Acceptance Of Confirmation
for 5 candidates in our community.

For Christmas, we distributed gifts (dolls for the girls and a bat and
ball for the boys) as well as packets of biscuits and Peppys to 30 poor
children of construction workers.
