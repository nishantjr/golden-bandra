### Legal Aid Cell

The Legal Aid / Reconciliation Cell of St. Andrew's Parish started
functioning during the tenure of Msgr. Nereus Rodrigues, sometime during
the late 1980s.

\

Since it's inception, Advocate Joaquim Reis has been rendering valuable
legal aid and reconciliation services, not only to the parishioners of
St. Andrew's but also to the other Catholics from the Archdiocese of
Mumbai. Until quite recently, the cell functioned once a week, on
Saturdays after the 8 a.m. mass.

\

In order to make the services rendered by the Cell available more often,
Fr. Adrian Phillips took the initiative of inviting Advocates to
volunteer their services on other days of the week. As such, with effect
from 1^st^ April 2004, the Cell functions most days of the week, either
during the morning hours or evening hours depending upon the convenience
of the Advocate.

\

The services provided by the Cell include advising persons on issues
relating to civic / criminal matters such as, property,
family/matrimonial disputes, tax problems, pending litigations and also
guidance as regards preparation of various legal documents.

\

The Cell also plans to organize talks/symposiums to familiarize and
create awareness among laypersons relating to their various rights and
other issues touching upon their day-to-day affairs.
