The Centre for Community Organisation (CCO) is a secular body recently
set up in the St. Andrew's Parish, Bandra. 

**The purpose of the CCO is to co-ordinate the activities of the various
Associations/Cells operating in the Parish with the various NGO's
operating within the Parish catchment's area for the benefit of all
residents in Bandra.  **

The CCO has the following vision:

**TO BE THE PREFERRED CENTRE & MEDIUM THROUGH WHICH
PERSONS/ORGANISATIONS OF ALL FAITHS GET INVOLVED & HARMONIOUSLY
INTEGRATE THEIR ACTIVITIES FOR A TRANSFORMED SOCIETY, ESPECIALLY BY WAY
OF SOCIAL ACTION.**

To achieve the above, the Parish has made available facilities like: 

The Bosco Hall for hosting seminars/conferences. It has the
infrastructure to accommodate approx. 200 people with aids like
projectors etc.\
A fortnightly leaflet called "The Happening" which lists ensuing
programmes to be held in the Bosco Hall & also functions around Bandra.
