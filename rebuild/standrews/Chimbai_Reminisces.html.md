### Chimbai Reminisces

St. Andrew being a fisherman, the fisher folks of Chimbai village had a
very important role to play in the construction of the Church. As my
grandmother recollects, the stones used for the construction of the
Church were transported by small boats from the lighthouse. In this
process a number of boats were damaged.\
\
The people being dedicated and skilled fishermen did not give up. The
people of Chimbai though hard working and talented were uneducated and
all thanks to Msgr. George Fernandes who encouraged sports whereby he
organised boat races, swimming competitions etc. He was also an
influence to the youth, and inspired by him an number of them devoted
themselves to the religious life. The people of Chimbai are still very
much involved and dedicated in church activities and this can be noticed
especially during the Holy Week and the feast of Christ the King.\
\
The old customs of this East Indian Community are still kept alive at
week long weddings, celebrations etc.\
