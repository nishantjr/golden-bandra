The Young Christian workers movement is an International movement
started by a Cardinal Joseph Cardijn in 1912 in Belgium. By 1965 the
movement had spread across the world even in our very own city of in
Bombay. The unit started at that time is still in operation at Sankli
street, Byculla.\
\
The movement primarily takes up issues that concern the working person
like you and me. We have not been able to make an impact but are able to
make a difference by the programmes we organise and the issues we take
up.\
\
Cardijn wanted the youth to develop their own philosophy of the
\"Christian Humanism of the workers.\" With this in mind the YCW in
Mumbai has developed it\'s objectives of **Service, Education and
Representation**.\
\
Cardijn encouraged the workers by helping them to educate themselves
through group discussions that would lead to a formation of life and
joint action. He summarised his method in the words **See, Judge and
Act**. This meant that by group reflection the laity should change their
lives, their working environment and motivate their colleagues to work
towards that end. This method of See, Judge and Act is still followed by
the YCW today.\
\
In the Mumbai Archdiocese, we have a presence in only 24 Parishes either
at the central level or as units in SCCs. These units organise
programmes as proposed by the executive committee or as per their local
need. We do not charge any membership fees for joining the YCW.\
\
**We have :**\

\
**At the diocesan level we have :** A bi-monthly newsletter titled
**\'Realities\'** that carries information and analysis on current
issues and creates awareness amongst the YCW members and others.\
\
The **Employment Network**, which pools our resources across the
archdiocese in terms of vacancies for jobs and job applications.\
\
A group of YCW intellectuals that reflect on current issues and
formulates a response and proposes an action plan aptly called the
**Think Tank Review and Action Group.**\
\
Through these various programmes and projects, we train our members in
leadership techniques and personality development to enable them to take
on the challenges of the work scenario and become responsible citizens,
able to stand up for their rights and make a difference in their places
of work.\
\
