The Oratory, Ranwar, 100 Years

'The' Oratory at Ranwar is a familiar landmark to residents and
passers-by alike. As far as all the present residents of the Village are
concerned, the Oratory has always been there. (That statement just about
could shave through, by a couple of years, as 'Aunty' Flavy Pereira,
who's house, 'The Trellis' adjoins the Oratory, will celebrate her 97th
birth day on the same day that the Oratory celebrates its 100th year.

To mark this special landmark the residents, past and present, of Ranwar
Village, along with friends, plan to organise several events through the
year, culminating on the **26th December 2006, in a solemn Mass at the
Oratory and a get together and dinner at the Rest Ranwar grounds.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1\.

The first such event will mark the start of the centenary year, on
**December 26, 2005**.\
As has happened, literally on thousands of evenings in the last
century,\
we plan to have a Rosary at the Oratory followed by the mandatory,
'boiled gram'\
(could we have a Village Rosary without boiled gram ?) and other light
refreshments.\

2\.

There will be evening **Rosary for whoever can attend, \
on the 27th, 28th, and 29th December 2005**. 

There will be a **Mass at the Oratory on December 30, 2005**\
Subsequently, on the **26th of each month there will be a Rosary at the
Oratory.**

3\.

Finally, on **December 26th 2006 we intend to have a solemn Mass
celebrated at the Oratory.**  \
This Mass will be 'hosted' by all the present Priests from Ranwar \
and we will invite other priests and bishops to the Mass.

We invite Ranwarites, in Ranwar, and all the many parts of the world,\
to plan to attend and to participate and be present at the **final
dinner on December 26th 2006**.\
Please inform as many people as you can - we assure you that The
Celebrations\
on December 26th 2006, will be an occasion to remember, so plan on being
there.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

To mark the occasion we plan **to publish a small brochure** with the
history of the Oratory and of Ranwar itself. \
If there is any material you have, articles or photographs that could be
included in the brochure please forward it to us.\
These could also be published on this website as appropriate.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

We are compiling **a list of Ranwarites and their families**. This list
is attached on this page. \
Please let us know if there are any additions or corrections. \
One of the things we plan to do is to put together a **'Ranwar Family
Tree' \
**with the names of past and present residents of the Village. To do
this we need inputs from you. \
E-mail us at\
<RanwarOratory@goldenbandra.com>
