      <p>The stone cross in St Andrew’s is as much a religious symbol as a
historical relic connecting St Andrew’s with its older sister church,
Santa Anna.</p>

<h3>History</h3>
<p>Sculpted in 1739, the cross originally stood in the compound of Santa
Anna, located near the present Bandra Suburban Railway Station. This
fortified church was the first in Bandra, and was destroyed in 1739 to
prevent it from falling into the hands of the Marathas. Fortunately, the
estate was bought around 1800 by Fr Francisco de Mello, a vicar of St
Andrew’s ensuring the preservation of the cross. In 1871 it was set up
in the south section of the St Andrew Church compound. In 1917-19, the
old pedestal was removed and the present dome-shaped pedestal was built.
The crosses whereabouts between 1739 and 1871 are unknown.</p>
<p>The cross was carved, likely using local stone from a quarry in Vile
Parle, Dongri or Bassein, probably by local artisans, already expert in
carving temple stone. Often stated to be carved from a single stone, a
monolith, it was constructed in two parts—there appears a clear joint in
the cross just below the two arms on the main upright.</p>
<p>An interesting local belief among the parishioners is that when some
disaster was about to occur a pink glow would be visible around this
cross.</p>
<h3>Carved Symbols</h3>
<p>The cross bears forty-five carvings on its faces. Of these twenty
symbols on the east face pertain to Christ’s passion, the <em>Arma
Christi</em> or <em>Instruments of the Passion</em>, while the twenty
symbols on the west face are symbols hinting at qualities and virtues of
Our Lady.</p>
<p>These symbols were used for catechetical purposes as a means of
religious instruction in the days when books were scarce. One can easily
picture the scene almost 250 years ago. At sundown perhaps, a Jesuit
padre gathered at the base of the cross with a crowd of the faithful. He
uses the detailed sculpted symbols, one after another to lead his rapt
congregation through the passion and death of our savior, and the many
virtues of Mary His mother.</p>

<p>There are three other sculptings on the cross. The <em>Titulus
Crucis</em>, attached to the top of the cross on both faces, INRI,
<em>Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum</em>, inscribed in Latin, Greek,
Hebrew, or Aramaic. The cross sculpted at the end of each arm is the
Cross of the Order of Christ, or the Cross of Portugal. This cross was
also displayed on the sails of the Portuguese caravels, carracks and
other ships involved in the exploration of the seas. And finally, at the
base of the east face, is carved the date 1678.</p>

<h3>Recognition</h3>
<p>The cross is unique and remarkable, not just withing Bandra and
India, but around the world. In the words of Dr Paolo Aranha a
historian, “your cross is a truly remarkable monument in terms of
symbolism and iconography … in my own personal experience I have never
come across such a cross … It is indeed a great merit of your community
and its pastors to have conserved so carefully such a precious witness
of your Christians origins.”</p>
<p>In recognition of its unique historical significance, the Mumbai
Heritage Commission has designated it a Grade I heritage structure, the
highest classification, and the Church as grade IIA, the next highest
classification.</p>
