<h1>The Varsity Circle</h1>
<hr />
<p>What could not be done by the whole host of our readers has been
achieved by on man – a single member of the Varsity Circle. We are not
boasting and we are not bragging, we’re merely stating the facts, and if
the facts should flatter us to the discredit of others, it will not be
through the fault of ours.</p>
<p>There certainly was no necessity for our making this number a one-man
concern but we thought we’d do it for lark. This was our way of meeting
the situation. We are living in an age of stunts and at the moment we
cannot conceive a more unique one than to get one man to shoulder the
whole hob and be responsible for everything from cover to cover in what
should have been the Readers’ Number.</p>
<p>Our idea in getting up a Readers Number was to give constributors a
much needed holiday. That object, in spite of our readers’ stubborn
non-cooperation, has now been achieved. True, one man has to work
over-time for this, but that one man would be condemned to hard labour
in any event. As for the promised Readers’ articles, they may now be
folded and shelved, we no longer require them – not for a Readers’
Number at least. We are through with the idea.</p>
<p>All things change and perhaps the contributor who so cleverly put
forward the plea that the Varsity Circle should more</p>
<hr />
<p>appropriately be called the Varsity Triangle will have good reason to
revise his opinion now. With the Editor on an indefinite leave and the
Rambler on an unprovoked strike, what was once a Circle and later
changed into a triangle has now dwindled to a mere point. Of course the
geometrical definition of a point – that is has position but no
magnitude is hardly calculated to flatter a well-meaning solo acting –
editor, but this does not bother us. We rather congratulate ourselves on
having discovered this jab on ourselves. But what we’re dealing with is
more than mere geometry, and a glance at our cover picture will reveal
to our unbelieving readers the Herculean task we are up against.</p>
<p>It comes in the experience of almost every mortal to get stuck
sometimes and we’re no exception. At the present moment we have stumbled
over the variety entertainment held recently in Bandra for the very
creditable purpose of giving relief to the unemployed. Apparently after
treating the cast and defraying such minor expenses as the hire of the
hall and a Royalty of Rupees 200 for the play there still remained a
tidy balance with which to carry out the object of the
entertainment.</p>
<p>The relief it appears took the shape of a grand banquet to which the
unemployed of the neighbourhood were invited, the idea being presumably
that ‘one crowded hour of gorgeous fare is worth an age without a meal.’
We give it up.</p>
<p>The ‘Adventures of Dan’ – the last article in this Number is not
exactly a new feature in this Magazine, but it is with- out doubt
something out of the usual run of articles recieved. We reserve our
comments and invite criticism.</p>

<h2>On Relics</h2>
<p>It was undoublebly a good purse. I turned it over in my hands and
subjected it to a thorough inspection. I passed the test and satisfied
me in every detail. It was light, capacious and aristocratic. What more
could one expect of a purse. Moreover it was cheap. But this was in fact
a drawback for, if it was cheap for me it was cheap for others as well,
and as the stuff was selling like hot buns, it would in a few days be in
the inside pocket of almost every other soul in Bombay. The thought
troubled me: Today an exclusive purse - a thing to be proud of,-
tomorrow just an ordinary, common place one. Still there was a chance
the stock might all get sold out, and there may be no more to put on the
market. I had made my decision – I would buy one.</p>
<p>Drawing out my own time-worn purse, I dipped my fingers in, in search
of a four-anna bit, and I was just handing the coin over to the
road-side hawker when something held me back. It was a resolution I had
made a fews days before when I got my second salary cut – to think twice
before I made any purchase in the future. “Is a new purse really
necessary?” I asked myself. “Well,” came the answer “but you know the
old one is getting shabbier every day, and then too it is rather a small
one - and, after all this other one is not at all expensive.” “Ah well”
I said “I’ll take it then.” … But I didn’t. I simply could now. an
invisible force held me back. Perhaps it was that still small voice that
had at last succeeded in catching my attention. I felt that I should not
take this purse in spite of all its enticements.</p>
<p>I drew out my purse once more and dropped the coin in it and while
the little scrap of soiled leather lingered in my moist fingers, I felt
a thrill that left me speechless. There was a lump in my throat - the
sort of thing that happens whenever I part with old friends - and then I
understood. How could I discard this friend of mind that had stood by me
in my every need, been my constant companion, my trusted servant, my
faithful and loyal friend. For, was it not the sole keeper of my scanty
fortunes and could I say that it had even once betrayed my trust? Why
then should I desert it now merely because my eyes were for the moment
dazzled by the empty splendour of a gayer one?</p>
<p>Small? Well, what if it were small? It were not so small that it
could not hold my entire salary. True it bulged badly, byt that was only
on pay-day - perhaps a few days longer. In less than a week it would be
normal again. Besides, with the depression becoming more and more acute
every day there surely would be more curs - I was quite optimistic about
it - and the my salary would fit comfortable in my dear old friend.</p>
<p>I felt overpowered with shame and remorse that I should have so much
as even thought of deserting this friend that had shared so many
intimate secrets with me. Banks go broke and humans too and none byt my
purse knows how many times I have been on the very brink of a financial
crisis. Whi for instance could guess that when only a few days ago I
sent an article to a magazine I had to say good-bye to it – not because
I was sure of it’s being accepted - but because I hadn’t enough money
for a stamp to enclose for it’s return postage. But this is only one of
the many instances when I have found myself thus driven to the wall. I
drew out my purse and gazed at it once more “Good for another ten years”
I soliquised ’ and may-be after that I will still be able to renovate
it.</p>
<p>An now perhaps some prosaic folk will dub me sentimental idiot and a
dreamer. I fancy they are not far wrong. Even I must admit that I have
carried this business a little beyond the limit of reason- ableness.
There is for instance the case of my old shoes I never discard a pair of
shoes that has served and more than served its legitimate use - I simply
cannot I did so once, I dumpped an old pair into a near-by dust-bin, and
that very night I caught myself stealing out of the house to salvage it.
And it was no -Aberdonian consideration that influenced me either. I
felt guilty and ashamed the sort of feeling I’d have if I left my dog
out of the house on a wet windy night. There is something so intimate
about a pair of shoes that I simply cannot make up my mind to discard
it. Even now as I gaze under my bed I see a row of six pairs. Only one
is fit for use, and as for the other five - even a sweeper would turn
his nose on them. Yet, there they are and there they will remain until
some day when I am away from home, somebody that starts a
spring-cleaning champaign and does the job. I’ve got sense enough to
realise that this must be dones unless I want to affiliate my house to
the Prince of Wales Museum, but I am content to let others do it for
me.</p>
<p>And my sentimental idiosyncracy is not confined only to purses and
old shows either. Indeed, it embraces almost anything I come into
contact with. I have with me even now a collection of relics some of
which are as many as ten years old. Every year adds something new to it
– trifles to others, but to me veritable treasures and oftentimes when I
fell like it I undo the sacred bundle and go reverently through it’s
contents, and this is one of those happy moments.</p>
<p>Here for instance is an empty flattened cigarette packet As I handle
it my memory carries my back to a certain railway carriage on the B.B.
Line. There is a home-coming picnic party and I am one of the group. We
are nearing Ville Parle and somebody hands a packet of cigarettes round.
When it reaches me there is only one cigarette left and I take it. I
start smoking and then on a sudden somebody there objects to my smoking
- somebody whose word was then more than law to me. There is only one
thing I can do and I do it without hesitation – the burning cigarette
goes flying out the carriage window. Everybody stares openmouthed - even
the “somebody” is shocked. The rest is better expressed from the
inscription on the empty packet which reads:</p>
<pre><code>                IN EVERY LOVING MEMORY OF
      the picnic to - on the 15th of May 1927. -- This empty
      packed was given to me on the evening of the picnic day by ---
      as a compensation for the cigarette which I threw out of the carriage window.</code></pre>
<p>But this is only one from my extensive collection – Hello, what’s
this? Ah yes, it is another of those little things that thrill my entire
being by their very touch : A small scrap of crumpled-up paper covered
with a scrawl which once was to me more beautiful and inspiring than
even copperplate.</p>
<pre><code>    &quot;Please take back the books lent us during the month of May
    for now we are in the month of June. ~~~ Noursih the Gold
    Fish during our absense and see that they do not fret for
    those whom they represent --- Good Bye.</code></pre>
<p>Thise gold-fish died, poor things. – and something else too, but for
now everything is connected with it is past history.</p>
<p>Then deeper down in the collection is another rare curio, a document
made out on a piece of old photographic printing-out paper which is now
almost gone to pieces. THe sensitive emulsion has peeled off in many
places carrying away with it parts of the writing. It was the handiest-
nay, the only available piece of paper at the time the hurried document
was drawn up, the whole transaction having occupied a little over five
minutes. The wording on this rare bit of rag written in what smattering
of legal terminology was known to us at the time will speak for
itself:</p>
<pre><code>    &quot;I do hereby truly and solemly promis to return to
     Mr --- or his agent the Book - Uncle Toms Cabin by
     Mrs H. B. Stowe. which he shall lend me on Monday
     within a day of his demanding the same after the
     22nd Inst., or in default pay as compensation the sum
     of Rupees five. In consideration of the above agreement
     and in payment of the obligation incurred I also
     promise to procure from the Petit Library any book required
     by the said Mr --- as far as is in my power to do so.

                        signed this 12th day of May 2028 A.D.

                                          ......
                                           S.D.</code></pre>
<p>That was the time when “Uncle Toms cabin” was being shown for the
first time at the Capitol. I had already read the book myself and the
story was</p>
<hr />
<p>still fresh in my memory – and now perhaps the sagacious reader will
guess why I went into the trouble of giving such an undertaking to get
it again.</p>
<p>Deeper down come the inevitable letters – not all of them are
‘yellow’ though. Theya re all tied up in a neat little bundle and I
won’t disturb them. I dont think I’m yet sufficiently steeled to
withstand the recollections that will surge up with reading them again,
and more over I’m not going to risk wetting the paper I’m writing on</p>
<p>Then here is a programme of “The Street Girl”, a picture shown at the
Excelcior when the talkies were first introduced there. That was indeed
a glorious evening with a fitting winding-up in the Soda-Foundain. True
it was a serious drain on the pocket but that was qat a time when
expenses never counted. The present alone mattered - yes, the present
which is now the bitter past - or, is it sweet, – I don’t know. All
these relics belong to a chapter of my life which is now closed. I come
now to a later period.</p>
<p>Here are tow sommonses to present myself at the — court to give
evidence in a case which created more than a sensation at the time. The
fact that the first of these bore the date of my birthday gave to it an
added significance. How important I felt when I received these. I don’t
think I’ll ever forget those fifteen minutes in the witness-box. It was
my first appearance there and my last I hope. The swearing-in procedure
had not been as solemn as I had expected. In fact I scarcely remember
having laid my hand on the Bible at all unless it was concealed
somewhere as William the Conqueror did with Harrold. But I remember only
too well how in the course of the cross- examination I turned the tables
on the counsel for the defense and caught him napping</p>
<pre><code>counsel: Have you ever spoken to the last witness?
self   : No - Never!
councel: Then you know him only by sight?
self   : Yes
Counsel: Did he ever speak to you about this case?
Self   : Yes. When he was leaving the court he told me I would be called next
Counsel: He did speak to you then. You said just now that you never talked to him.
Self   : And I didn&#39;t. I should like you to understand that it was HE who
         spoke to me, and I did not reply.
Counsel: (mum) ...... ~~you may go now~~. ---(Applause from Court)</code></pre>
<hr />
<pre><code>And here is some-thing different - a wad of Congress</code></pre>
<p>Bulletins[^bombay-bulletin]. They are the earliest numbers and I
preserved them in the hope of obtaining a huge price for them later. No
offers have yet been made, but I can afford to wait. This finishes with
all the big relics. What is left now is merely crumbs, a heap of Railway
tickets and empty envelopes bearing the tell-tale legends – Lonavla -
Kirkee - Bassein - Poona - Deolali. There is a receipt from the
Custodian of the Karla Caves preserved as a proof of my having visited
the place.</p>
<p>I’m going to have the deuce of a job putting these things all by, but
I’ll put them by all right. There isn’t the ghost of a chance of even
one of them going astray. I’m too jealous about them. On more than one
occasion I tried to lessen the heap by destroying the less important
items, but it was useless, for I could never decide which of them was
less important. They were all equally important to me. Each one of them
is a sort of landmark in my onward journey. True, most of them mark
spots where I stumbled and got hurt badle, but the passing of years has
now softened the painful effect, and I can now afford to smile at my
past follies. I’m afraid of losing count of the distance I’ve trudged by
demolishing even the littlest of these records, with the inevitable
result that every time I made an attempt to spring clean the collection
I had to give it up in despair – and now it’s a safe bet that however
else these things will meet their end, it will never be at my hands.</p>
<p>The sad part is that we’ll never know how much sooner the depression
would have ended if statesmen had let it alone.</p>
