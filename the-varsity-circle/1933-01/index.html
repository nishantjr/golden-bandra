<div class="line-block">      “The road to hell is paved with good
intentions”, and<br />
the road to heaven too must necessarily be, with this little distinction
however, that<br />
whereas in the first case the sesolutions are broken, in the second they
are kept.<br />
We are now in the New Year and what more natural than that glancing
back<br />
at its past life the V.C should repent of it’s past sins and resolve to
do better<br />
in future. Yes, we are going to make good resolutions – a whole string
of<br />
them, but our resolutions will be mostly on behalf of others, and,
whether or<br />
not we are heading for heaven – or the other place, will depend largely
on<br />
how faithfully our readers and contributors carry out the
resolutions.<br />
<br />
      For one thing we’ll resolve to have a Readers Number<br />
next March – the anniversary of our last Readers Number,– which
will<br />
contain contributions by readers only. Readers will therefore kindly
arrange<br />
matters so that they will be “in a mood” to write as soon as feasible,
and<br />
try to catch by the “narrative” the elusive “tomorrow” on which their
article<br />
is to be begun. On our part we have already informed the local post
office<br />
authorities and they will be more careful this time to see that no
contributions<br />
are lost in transit – as was the case last year. – N.B. The above<br />
resolution is born of another resolution of ours to give the Rambler
and<br />
other V.C contributors an annual holiday.<br />
<br />
  Our next resolution for readers is that they do a little<br />
spring cleaning occasionally and see if they cannot trace some of our
back<br />
numbers. There are quite a number of thiese on the missing list by
now,</div>
<p><img src="./05.jpg" alt="Page 5" /></p>
<div class="line-block">and unless matters improve soon we will be
constrained however reluctantly<br />
to rally together our V.C sleuths from all other directions and put them
on<br />
the job. We have not yet got a complete list of the missing magazines,
but we<br />
hope to within a month. Perhaps before that time sone of our readers
will<br />
think of dusting their book shelves, and start making discoveries.<br />
<br />
Our third resolution will be for V.C contributors, and<br />
we’ll resolve for them that they will commence their articles for the
February<br />
Number today – NOW, and hand it over to us tomorrow.<br />
<br />
And as for ourselves we truly and solemnly resolve<br />
that in spite of all impediment and drawbacks, and all foreseen
and<br />
unfore-seen circumstances we shall and will and must get our<br />
January Number our before the 28th of February 1933.<br />

GOLDEN RULE. 1933 Version: “Expect to be done as you would<br />

<p><img src="./06.jpg" alt="Page 6" /></p>
<h1 id="the-rambler">The Rambler</h1>
<div class="line-block">What do you say, dear reader to rambling about
the<br />
ways of parting. No, I am not thinking about the ways and means of
parting<br />
company with you and the V.C; that I’ll only do if I get a better
opening else-<br />
where. But we shall consider in this short article (it has got to be
short, because<br />
I have not much to say) the different manners in which people enjoy each
others<br />
company. I have yet to come across the man who can part with me
without<br />
lingering, not that I am very plesant company, but I have such a knack
of<br />
sticking on to people that they cannot but stay on. I usually chat
longer than is<br />
necessary and when I get up to go, I always expect my host to accompany
me to<br />
the door; and at the door usually some topic of the other crops up and
we fall<br />
to talking for another half-hour or so. He then comes to leave me at the
golden gate,<br />
and at that place we again make station until in the end he actually
tears<br />
away from me or I from him (This latter of course is very rare).<br />
<br />
Often times I go to a friend and declare most solemly<br />
that I must leave him in half an hour; but that half hour passes and yet
I can-<br />
not part, for, if the company is interesting I like to stay on, and if
it is not, then<br />
I would like to make it pleasant before I leave it. Thus I often stay on
and make<br />
the pleasant dull by over-indulgence, or, if unpleasant already I only
succeed in<br />
making it still more so. No, I am not a bore, and often my companion
too<br />
like to be longer with me. But of course you have a right to form
what-<br />
ever opinion you like of me and if I bore you as ‘The Rambler’, you
may<br />
call me so.<br />
<br />
And now, since I have promised to be short I must<br />
close up my shop for the present; but as far as possible I always like
to part<br />
with a joke and at present some four jokes come to mind. I am not in
a<br />
mood to sit and select the best of them, and besides, giving all the
four will<br />
fill so much more space. It is the raining season now and a school boy
might</div>
<p><img src="./07.jpg" alt="Page 7" /></p>
<div class="line-block">well come dripping wet to class in the hope of a
holidy. Once such a boy<br />
was asked why he had not used his umbrella and he replied that he
wanted<br />
to defy the rain; so the teacher asked him to defy the wet clothes and
stay on.<br />
But let us come to regard the most interesting subject in the<br />
world, woman (the subject is an interesting one for men, of course).
There<br />
was a certain gentleman of my acquaintance who used to pass on his<br />
books one after another to his sweet-heart (who of did not recognise
him<br />
to hld the same reciprocal relation to herself), and when asked
his<br />
reason for doing so, replied that he wanted his books to be consecrated
by<br />
her touch. I cannot end this series of jokes bettern than by telling you
that<br />
the philosopher has been defined as a blind aman in a dark room,
trying<br />
to find a black cat is not there!<br />

<h1 id="our-diary">OUR DIARY</h1>
<div class="line-block">  Friday 1st January 1932<br />
<br />
  So, the new year has come at last. What has it in store<br />
for us? Time alone will reveal. Perhaps it will usher in a period of
renewed<br />
prosperity; perhaps on the other hand it will only accentuate the
misery<br />
and suffering of the past year.<br />
<br />
  Times are indeed bad! The past few years have been lean<br />
years for all, every succeeding year worse than the other. Will this
year be another<br />
in the chain of bad ones, will it be yet another, yea, and a worse phase
of the hard<br />
times which have been so persistently dogging our very footsteps, or
will it be one<br />
that will break the string and stand out as the turning point in the
fortunes of the<br />
world. Prosporous times will not visit one nations and pass over
another. It goes againt<br />
the very grain of things, – against the law of nature for we are so
dependant upon one<br />
another for the necessities of life that ther can be no prosperity,
except it be<br />
general. Treaties and pacts may be made ad.libitum, tarrif walls may be
build as<br />
high as ever, yet ther is a lay governing these things which will last
for ever - a law<br />
which in it’s own good time will effect an adjustment in the affairs of
men and of nations<br />
<br />
  I’m not thinking of socialism, nor do I vision a common -<br />
wealth of nations. No, nations will retain their identity as long as the
people that go<br />
to make them retain their individuality. There is no need for an
amalgamation of the<br />
world for world peace and prosperity. The trouble today is that we are
all suffering<br />
from an acute depression, and all suspecting one another of being the
cause of it. Let<br />
times improve and then our relations with one another will also improve.
And then, when<br />
good times have at last arrived round the corner, let our politicians
and economists and<br />
trade magnates go cautiously. Let them remember that the present chaos
is the result of<br />
their own folly and recklessness and want of foresight, and let them
beware of falling into<br />
the rut again. Let them build up their resources with the future well
before them, and not<br />
think only of the present – the immediate present.<br />

<h1 id="the-cinema">THE CINEMA</h1>
<div class="line-block">“The curse of mankind , the plague of humanity,
the eye-<br />
sore of society, the mockery of decency, the shame of
civilization”–these<br />
and many other such abuses have been heaped upon the Cinema. This
creation of<br />
modern science has been misused and abused till it’s primary function
is<br />
scarcely recognisable.<br />
<br />
Fresh from the recesses of unknown laboratories of the<br />
world’s scientists this child of inventive brains was brought into the
world mainly<br />
for educative purposes; but snatched from it’s home and it’s poor
surroundings,<br />
to fill their overflowing coffers, by pandering to the low taste of
millions who<br />
what filth and were willing to pay for it.<br />
<br />
But Truth has risen triumphant and the censor has<br />
done much to stamp out the evil, aided by an enlightened public , who,
after the<br />
gloss has been rubbed off, have realised that the broadmindedness need
not include<br />
indulgence of imorality and Art need not be mere sensuality.-<br />
<br />
The Cinema is slowly but surely regaining its lost place<br />
in the Scientific and Educational world. Never in its life of a score or
more<br />
years have producers been so eager to have pictures of educational value
and<br />
interest, than when they spent millions of dollars, and years of labour
to give us<br />
the unique opportunity of hearing “Africa Speak” or of following “Trader
Horn” through<br />
desert wastes and jungle wilds, nay even of taking us to the “East of
Borneo”,<br />
or of making us live the lives of our ancestor “Tarzan the Ape-Man”
Need<br />
further proof be given of the realization of this craving in the Public
Mind for<br />
such educative films, when the Fox Corporation, M.G.M., Paramounts and
Columbia<br />
are all vying with one another for the best production in this
sphere<br />
<br />
But why restrict ourselves to mere educational films. I<br />
take it that you have seen the immortal “Ben-Hur”; need we a Gandhi
to</div>
<p><img src="./11.jpg" alt="Page 11" /></p>
<div class="line-block">inspire us with patriotism when those four word
vibrate our very<br />
heart-strings - “I am a JEW.” And with Jackie Cooper in the “Champ”
need<br />
we even the Commandment “Honour thy father and thy mother.” Nay, Nay,
leave<br />
these outstanding mighties on their pedestals, and come to the lower
order. Shall we<br />
see “All Quiet on the Western Front” to realise the folly of our ways
and the useless-<br />
ness of rank hypocrisy: shall we spend the evening with the Vagabond
King and<br />
learn from that beggar-monarch that an ideal in life can do more than a
thousand<br />
precepts or sermons; that a kind deed and a gentle word of understanding
and<br />
sympathy can accomplish what months of imprisonment and torture would
only<br />
make more difficult to achieve.<br />
<br />
Where shall we go, whither shall we turn? Speak you<br />
of repulsive bathroom scenes and half naked chorus-girls, not to refer
to bed-room<br />
scenes that show bad taste? These things must be! Leave them to
themselves,<br />
and they too shall soon take their turn to oblivion; you have even now a
fairly<br />
good variety to choose from.<br />
<br />
Shall we step in to learn the psychology of husbands<br />
from the “Husband’s Holiday”; or shall we see the evils of bribery and
corruption<br />
in our judges and guardians of the law in “Night Court”? Would you
prefer<br />
to go “Round the World in Eighty-Minutes,” or perchance to “Just Imagine
yourself<br />
living in 1980.<br />
<br />
Shall we leave these for other folk and turn to the lighter<br />
Metrotone News and hear the Native Savage of the Fiji Isles sing on
their moon-lit<br />
shores or gaze upon the glamourous Hava dancing languidly under
the<br />
swinging palms. Would you like the Pathe Gazette with a special
supplement<br />
of the Derby, or Paramounts’ special the “Final Test Match” or British
Movietones’<br />
“The Great Boat Race? Why not try a ride in Fox’s Magic Carpet and fly
round<br />
the world over the tops of Egypt’s Pyramids, or over the mighty rush of
the<br />
Niagra Falls, of float over Everest’s peak unconquered yet, or gaze
down<br />
Etna’s crater slumbering still? All these and more are at your
beck<br />
and call; behold the work of Man!</div>
<p><img src="./12.jpg" alt="Page 12" /></p>
<div class="line-block">Uh, I forgot! You are a lover of Nature. Well,
well,<br />
shall we see how the King Butterfly is born or would you have the Queen
Bee<br />
reign amidst the drones? Maybe that wont satisfy you either. I must
say<br />
you are very difficult to please; anyway I’ll try another change. Ha,
ha! how<br />
you recoil! Why, such things actually happen: surprised are you? ’Tis
but<br />
one of the millions of filthy hutsand vermin hot-houses that exist in
India today.<br />
The people who live in them scarcely realise the danger and those who
are in the<br />
know care not to help them. And now you are seeing the havoc that a
single Fair<br />
in India can do, when scores and scores are swept away be Cholera,
and<br />
what’s worse, -often Plague.<br />
<br />
And now you say “Stop”, and stop I surely will,<br />
but not before you admit that you are satisfied, be it in Comedy
or<br />
Tragedy, Romance or Adventure, we shall still find enough therein to
satisfy<br />
our craving for intellectual recreation. And now with the Talkies can
we<br />
want more? Swept off our feet by a Jeanette Macdonald or thrilled to
action<br />
by a Tibbet; set a-tingling by a Chavelier, or dreaming old-time dreams
with<br />
the Gaynor, we might well fear with Shakespeare that “surfeiting, the
appertite<br />
may sicken and so die”.<br />

<h1 id="the-machine">The Machine</h1>
<div class="line-block">“Let the show-maker stick to his last” is a
saying which<br />
has without doubt stood the test of ages. Still, the show-maker cannot
always be<br />
making shows. For a change, as much as for recreation and diversion he
may take<br />
to something else; for instance he may learn to play the saxaphone, and,
if in his<br />
first attempts he sets the neighbourhood on edge with ghastly sounds
resembling a<br />
cat and dog fight, we shall not be too hard on him shall we?<br />
<br />
So far I’ve mostly contented myself with writing on frivolous<br />
subjects, and I must confess Id never have thought of going off the
groove were<br />
I not at this moment rather hard-pressed for a subject. To be honest I’m
never<br />
at my best on a serious topic, but I’m going to see this through even if
it costs<br />
me my present self-esteem or my past reputation. At the worst my attempt
will<br />
be a miserable failure but on the other hand, it’s success will open out
to<br />
me new walks of life and fresh avenues of research. The attemp is worth
the<br />
stakes, and I’ll make it.<br />
<br />
And, having come so far som of my readers may perhaps<br />
think that I’m just making much ado about nothing. – I am! Being just
now<br />
in a very confidential mood I dont mind admitting things (still there’s
a limit,<br />
and certain intimate questions would not even now evoke an answer) and
I’ll say<br />
this, that I’m merely trying at present to fill the pages at all costs
because I<br />
am afraid I wont have enough to say on the subject I have chosen for my
article.<br />
<br />
The subject I have decided to write upon is “The Machine”.<br />
It is a topic which is very widely discussed at the present moment and
it was<br />
a recent statement of the “Rambler” relative to it which turned my mind
in this<br />
direction – although I wil not say that I never thought on the matter
before<br />
<br />
Of course, were it not for the trade depression – for this<br />
aweful business slump, the like of which has never been experienced
before, the<br />
machine would scarcely have come to be the subject of such a universal
discussion.<br />
Slave as it was meant to be, it would have continued to work for and
enrich</div>
<p><img src="./15.jpg" alt="Page 15" /></p>
<div class="line-block">it’s masters, and nobody would have given it
even a second thought. Such has been<br />
our actual experience in the days of our prosperity not many years ago.
Then the<br />
machine was never thought of except as a labour-saving device and a
means of making<br />
millionaires and multi-millionaires. That was when the machine was
fulfilling it’s<br />
functions, or, to be more correct – when current conditions made it
appear so, and<br />
people were deluded into the satisfaction that all was well and
normal.<br />
<br />
But things are different now. Conditions have changed and<br />
dreams have been shattered, and we now find ourselves heading towards a
state of<br />
affairs that is every day becoming more and more impossible. As to why
these things<br />
have happened I will not even pretend to answer. The matter is beyond me
– nay,<br />
beyond even our world economistsl, for, the very continued existence of
the trouble<br />
for such a long time now is sufficient proof that they dont know either
what<br />
is wrong with business, or how things could be improved. However, be the
reason<br />
what it may, here we are in the very depths of an industrial depression
of<br />
unprecedented dimensions, and among other things the maching is blamed
for the mishap.<br />
<br />
The charge against the machine is three-fold. In the<br />
first place it is contented that the machine is the cause of the
over-production<br />
which is claimed to be at the bottom of the present economic break-down;
in the<br />
next, the machine is blamed for throwing thousands of men out of
employment,<br />
men who, before the advent of the maching could always find some work to
do.<br />
And finally it is said that the machine is the cause of the unequal
distribution of<br />
wealth which has in so many countries had a reaction in the shape of
chronic<br />
class hatred and communistic drives.<br />
<br />
Still, when one looks back through the pages of history,<br />
one cannot help but take a more optimistic view of the present state of
affairs<br />
and realise that with but a clear-thinking and right-doing, all will yet
come<br />
right. Away back in the nineteenth century when the hand-looms were
replaced by<br />
the efficient machinery which threw thousands out of employment and
earned the<br />
opprobrium of whole communities, men were as pessimistic about the
future<br />
economic situation as they were at the present time. But their fears
were soon</div>
<p><img src="./16.jpg" alt="Page 16" /></p>
<div class="line-block">to be allayed, for, instead of increasing
unemployment, the textile industry did an<br />
unthinkable thing – it gradually created more jobs and absorbed more of
the<br />
population. And the cause of this seeming miracle was not difficult to
find.<br />
Efficient machinery meant reduced overheads, cheaper products and
consequently more<br />
extensive markets. The increased demand meant increased production which
in turn<br />
meant wider employment, and thus the circle was complete. But there was
one<br />
flaw in the system, a flaw which was not noticed then, not because it
was less<br />
of a flaw, but merely because there were other conditions
counter-balancing or<br />
rather concealing it, and otherwise preventing it from being seen uin
all it’s<br />
reality – but of this later. After all, labour-saving devices need not
mean<br />
unemployment, and the revolution which the machine introduced into
textile industry<br />
should have thaught us a lesson – but it didn’t.<br />
<br />
One of the big reasons attributed by people for the existing<br />
economic chaos is the overproduction of commodities both manufactures
and<br />
agricultural products. But “overproduction” is indeed a poor term to use
for des-<br />
scribing a state of affairs which is considerably worse than that.
Self-deception<br />
unfortunately has always been a characteristic feature of our present
generation, and<br />
it is therefore quite understandable that what should properly have been
termed<br />
“mal-distribution”, should fondly be called “over-production”” and left
at that.<br />
All things considered, the world with all it’s efficient machinary is
yet not able<br />
to cope with the normal needs of the people which though seemingly
satisfied<br />
are in reality ver far from it. We must do without a car or wiht one
meal<br />
a day not because we dont need a car or are satisfied with but one
meal,<br />
nor because there are no eats or foodstuffs to be had, but merely
because being<br />
“broke”, we simply cannot afford these things although they are there,
and<br />
rotting for want of purchasers.<br />
<br />
Another big crime of the maching is that it has<br />
taken the bread out of the mouth of thousands of families by driving
the<br />
wage-earners out of employment, and for the solution of this difficulty
we haven’t<br />
to go further than to the very next objection to the machine – that it
only</div>
<p><img src="./17.jpg" alt="Page 17" /></p>
<div class="line-block">helps to effect a very unequal and unjust
distribution of wealth. If we are<br />
able to find a way out of this third objection we will have won a triple
victory<br />
for we will then have dound an answer to the other two objections to the
machine, as<br />
these in fact are merely the outcome of this unequal distribution of
wealth.<br />
<br />
This third objection I hardly mention is a real one,<br />
the only one in fact, for it is the abuse of the machine by
profit-seeking capitalists<br />
that has to a great extent been responsible for the present state of
affairs. I’m not<br />
so sure of it, but I think one could even be excused for blaming the
whole<br />
depression, if not on this abuse of the machine, then at least on the
same<br />
human greed and avarice which has led men to exploit the machine and
human labour.<br />
<br />
It has been a short-sighted policy with regard to the<br />
machine that has worked our downfall. Men thought of the machine not as
a<br />
means of benefitting humanity as a whole but merely of enriching
themselves at the<br />
expense of those less fortunate mortals who were dependant on them for a
living.<br />
Our greed and selfishness has been our misfortune, for, though when
conditions were<br />
abnormal, prospects did look rosy, now after years of adjustments we
find that<br />
something is wrong somewhere, and while trying every possible remedy for
the<br />
trouble we are deliberately blinding ourselves to the one and only
remedy<br />
that can effect a sure and a permanent cure.<br />
<br />
And, what is this something which is causing the<br />
whole trouble and which holds the magic cure to all our ills? The
experience<br />
of the past should have revealed it to us and served as a lesson for the
future,<br />
but unfortunately it didn’t. Machinery by it’s very nature replaces
human labour –<br />
is meant to replace it. But machinery also cheapens things to an extent
that puts<br />
them within the reach of the millions and so secures a market large
enough to<br />
enable more ment to be employed as long as the demand for the product
continues,<br />
– and here comes the crux of the whole matter. The great thing is for
the<br />
demant to continue – not only to continue but to increase in proportion
to the<br />
population. Now, as long as the relative wealth of the consumers and
manufacturers<br />
can be maintained at a ratio that is conducive to the propserity of
both, the</div>
<p><img src="./18.jpg" alt="Page 18" /></p>
<div class="line-block">demand must of necessity keep pase with the
population. The maintenance of this<br />
ration is by no means an easy matter but it is a result we have to
acheive<br />
if we are at all serious about getting out of the rut into which we
have<br />
fallen. At every turn we are bound to be faced by complications that
would<br />
make the situation seem impossible of solution – but there never<br />
was any real acheivement without a corresponding struggle.<br />
<br />
Still, while it is all-important that we preserve this<br />
ration of wealth between the employing and the wage earning classes, it
is all<br />
the more important that the wealth of the latter should be spread over
as<br />
many workers as possible so that the greater proportion of the wages
will be<br />
returned to circulation and keep business going. This plan will mean
reduced<br />
wages by all means but that only in the initial stages, for, as the
movement<br />
gains momentum, conditions must eventually improve with the result
that<br />
wages in all probability will even rise to higher levels than at
present. But<br />
this is not all that must be done if continued prosperity is to be
achieved.<br />
Ager all the Machine does not exist solely for the benefit of
capitalists and<br />
millionaires. The working class have a right to a greater share of it’s
benefits<br />
than falls to their log at present and the sooner this fact is realised
the<br />
better both for them and for their employers.<br />
<br />
When all is said, the Machine stands for saving in<br />
time. We want more leisure, but we want leisure while still retaining
our<br />
jobs. The advent of the Machine has without doubt gradually done away
with<br />
a lot of drudgery of former days, but is this all it can achieve.
Surely<br />
not! The work of the Machine has only just begun. It’s ultimate
mission<br />
is a unique one, for it’s sole purpose will be to provide as much
enemployment<br />
as possible for the employed. Things have now come to a pass when
we<br />
must provide work for as many workers as possible<br />
by giving less hours of work and more of leisure. After all,<br />
if civilization is to make any real progress we must try and arrange
matters so<br />
that the education of the masses will be a matter more easy
attainment</div>
<p><img src="./19.jpg" alt="Page 19" /></p>
<div class="line-block">than at present, and the only conditions under
which this is possible is more<br />
leisure and sufficient wealth.<br />
<br />
Reduced hours of work – that is what we must work<br />
for, and when we have got it in a sufficient degree we will bo on the
high-road<br />
to an ideal state of affairs – a veritable era of prosperity with no
more fear of<br />
hard times. At the outset this will mean a sacrifice to employers but it
will<br />
never-the-less be a gilt-edged investment with promises of big returns.
It will mean<br />
employment not only of men but of money too – money which at present is
idle<br />
while millions are out of work and starving.<br />
<br />
And more leisure for the millions will mean a wider<br />
outlook for them, more interests in life, and more “outside” occupation,
new needs, and<br />
new demants. And to cope with these demands new industries will spring
up, more<br />
hands will find employment, more wealth will be distributed and
re-distributed,<br />
and man will have reacheed the zenith of his ambition – the betterment
of the human<br />
race in general and the establishment of mutual relationship between the
two now<br />
conflicting classes – Capital and Labour!<br />
