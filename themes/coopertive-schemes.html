      <h1> Coopertive Schemes </h1>
      <p>A major contributor to making Bandra a garden city was the role of
two cooperative schemes, the Salsette and St Sebastian Schemes. Both of
these were the brainchild of FAC Rebello who had been a prominent member
of the Bombay government scene. Because of deep knowledge of how the
schemes were designed, he was able to merge the Cooperative Act of 1915
with the Town Planning A00ct of 19nn, He was able to get the local
landowners, both the large properties and the smaller one with
fractional land holdings to pool their lands and in return receive
developed plots. Members were encouraged to develop their plots
according to their means and were provided loans to do so. . As result
the Cooperative schemes were models of self development nd the benefits
persisted long after the rest of Greater Bombay succumbed to the
pressure of development exigencies</p>
