TPS Town Planning schemes beginning 1918 soon generated a series of changes in
Bandra which larely made it what it was for the next half century and which made
Bandra the Queen of the Suburbs. After the plague in Bombay, there was need for
accommodation for the burgeoning population and the government launched an
ambitious and extremely progressive development programme The TPS program)
Initially it was implemented by the local government (TPS 1 and 2) but then the
Bombay government set up a development board with better resources, financial
and managerial. The schenes were among the most advanced, even as compared to
European countries, \[preserving the environment while catering to the ever
increasing demand for accommodation. There were about a 100 such schemes in
Salsette and soon the increasing demand resulted in a dilution of some of the
most attractive aspects of the TPS. But the Bandra Municipality resisted the
populist tendencies that resulted in the rest of the Salsette schemes being
diluted . While other suburbs, from Andheri to Chembur, allowed for greater
congestion and higher buildings, Bandra remained a garden city with bungalows
each with a garden.
