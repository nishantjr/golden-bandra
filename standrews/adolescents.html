<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Parents today find it very difficult to communicate and often a challenge to relate to their adolescent children. Dr.Yolande Pereira an eminent clinical psychologist & family therapist addresssed this issue in a presentation, <b>"The Challenge of Relating to the Adolescent of Today"</b> held on June 13, 2004 at the Bosco Hall.
<BR><BR>
This programme was organised by the family cell of St.Andrew's Parish as a way of enriching the social & spiritual aspect of family life. Awareness was done through  handouts, announcements, and even phone calls which added a personal touch. It was also advertised in the Bandra Metro.
<BR><BR>
The talk began at 10:30AM and ended at 12:30PM. Quite a number of people attended this session as the topic is the crying need of the hour. Dr.Yolande covered various important topics like How to deal with adolescents and how to talk to them ? She went on to touch on other aspects of their likes, dislikes, mood swings, attitudes, tone, relationships and so on.

The people were also educated on the differences between a psychiatrist and psychologist which is often misunderstood. Every parent was listening so attentively and with so much interest that even after 2 hours it seemed like no one wanted to go home.
<BR><BR>
A questionnaire was distributed and there was also a question answer session at the end. A suggestion was put across that another session must be held especially for the adolescents. 
<BR><BR>
This programme was attended by people from various parishes and in the feedback received, many parents felt that it was really worth coming for this programme. One parent said that she did learn a few things, one of which was "listening" and also looking at situations from the child's perspective. Another parent was there to learn how to deal with her kids, where communication was a problem, and said that this talk helped her a great deal. She only hopes that she continues to practice what she learnt at home.
<BR><BR>
To conclude this was Good Advice and a great learning for parents.
