      <P>Kane Road & Mt.Mary Road Community are home to the X community consisting of 
approximately 70 families. The zonal core group meetings are attended by between 5-8 
members. 
<br><br>
<u>October 2003</u><br>
The rosary was held at various venues to increase participation. On the last day the 
Rosary was held at the Room behind Mt.Mary church. All the venues were very well 
attended and the idea appreciated. This fostered communitarian togetherness. The 
traditional boiled grams and cold drinks were served on the last day. Apart from this the 
core group has also reached out to the sick and aged of the community from time to time.

<u>November 2003</u><br>
We had no programme in this month but visited the house bound and sick & elderly 
members of our community. Since this was also the month of the ‘Celebrate Bandra’ 
therefore all members were attending the cultural programmes organised.
<br><br>
<u>December 2003</u><br>
We decided to go carol singing this year as no groups had come to our community in the 
last 4 years. Despite the usual ups & downs we managed to get a group together and went 
carol singing on Dec.22nd special metion needs to be made that Maria with her beautiful 
voice and Ashwin Rodrigues accompanied on guitar despite his busy schedule. We were 
showered with a lot of praise, cakes, sweets and money which was not our intention. 
Though we did manage to spread a lot of good cheer in the season to be merry.
<br><br>
We visited the home bound sick and a member who had recently lost her husband. The 
money we collected from the carol singing was used to buy small gifts for them. This 
gesture was appreciated and welcomed by those whose lives we had touched. By all this 
we were able to spread the love, peace and joy of the Baby Jesus.</P></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
