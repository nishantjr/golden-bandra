<h3> <P>Sodalities</P> </h3>
<P>Among the Parish organisations, the various Sodalities are an
important group of activities that through the years have fostered
the spiritual development of our parishioners. The website will be
posting information on these sodalities, some more active than others
at the present time, their background, focus and activities. The
information presented below is from the various Parish publications
and we apologise if some information is not current. We intend to
update this as soon as we have the material.</P>
<P>Men's Sodality</P>
<P>Established in 1933, with the Rev. Fr D. De Sa as the first
Director and Fr Henry J Remedios as Assistant Director.The main
activities were literary and the promotion of Catholic literature..
Under Mgr George Fernandes in the 1960s the Sodality played a more
active role, assisting the Parish Priest in community activities like
collections, census activities and the Catholic Enquiry Centre as
also the Church Ushers.</P>
<P>Ladies' Sodality</P>
<P>Founded on December 8th, 1920 under the patronage of Our Lady of
the Immaculate Conception and St Anne this sodlaity is involved with
various Church activities besides spiritual endeavours. From Church
Support fund raising to the Burse collection to the altar and church
decorations the Ladies' Sodality has been a pillar of the Church,
assisting the Parish Priest through the years.</P>
<P>There are three sections of the Ladies' Sodality, the English,
Konkani (1947; Mgr Macario Pereira) and Marathi (1962; Mgr George
Fernandes) sections, all very dedicated and active in the service of
parish activities.Presently these organisations are doing valuable
work helping in such areas as Mission Sunday collections and Street
Children assistance programs.</P>
