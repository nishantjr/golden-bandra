<h3>Legal Aid Cell</h3>
<P>The Legal Aid /
Reconciliation Cell of St. Andrew&rsquo;s Parish started functioning
during the tenure of Msgr. Nereus Rodrigues, sometime during the late
1980s.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>Since it&rsquo;s
inception, Advocate Joaquim Reis has been rendering valuable legal
aid and reconciliation services, not only to the parishioners of St.
Andrew&rsquo;s but also to the other Catholics from the Archdiocese
of Mumbai. Until quite recently, the cell functioned once a week, on
Saturdays after the 8 a.m. mass.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>In order to make the
services rendered by the Cell available more often, Fr. Adrian
Phillips took the initiative of inviting Advocates to volunteer their
services on other days of the week. As such, with effect from 1<SUP>st</SUP>
April 2004, the Cell functions most days of the week, either during
the morning hours or evening hours depending upon the convenience of
the Advocate.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The services provided by
the Cell include advising persons on issues relating to civic /
criminal matters such as, property, family/matrimonial disputes, tax
problems, pending litigations and also guidance as regards
preparation of various legal documents.</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P>The Cell also plans to
organize talks/symposiums to familiarize and create awareness among
laypersons relating to their various rights and other issues touching
upon their day-to-day affairs.</P>
