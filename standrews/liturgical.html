<h3>Liturgical Group</h3>
<P>The Liturgical Group is
20 years old and comprises of 8-10 members. It meets every alternate
Monday from 6:30 p.m. onwards. If a member/members are unable to
attend, the group is informed and a prayer is said. The member who
has prepared the liturgy requests someone to read from the Missal.
This goes on till the Gospel and the introductions are read,
corrected and passed. The same holds for the Prayer of the Faithful.</P>
<P>The liturgy is prepared
for all the Sundays and Feast days. We work under the guidance of the
Spiritual Director, presently Fr. Serrao.</P>
<P>A schedule is drawn up,
posted on the Notice Board near the Sacristy, giving the names of
members who have agreed to write the liturgy and when id has to be
presented.</P>
