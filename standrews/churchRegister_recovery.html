<h3>Recovery of a Church Register - 2001 </h3>
Recounted by Clarence Fernandes
<br><br>
<i>
[An event, that as someone remarked, would have affected the documentary evidence of legitimacy or otherwise of hundreds of parishioners whose parents happened to be married in St Andrews between the years 1909 and 1915. This article is contributed by Clarence Fernandes, an honorary parishioner of St Andrew's, who has for the last decade and more been quietly and painstakingly working on our parish registers- translating and deciphering them.]
</i><br><br>
A remarkable occurence in 2001 was the recovery of a Church Marriage Register which had been missing for more than fifty years.
<br><br>
Clarence Fernandes, who researches on the Church Registers, was informed by his brother Winston Fernandes, Architect, that there was on the premises and in the possession of an embosser in Boran village, formerly bookbinder, a ledger-type volume, contents of which he could not understand.  This volume had been lying with him for over fifty years. It was shown to Winston Fernandes but he could not read it either.  But he did  notice names like "Bazar Road" and "D'Monte Street" and judged that it was a Church Register. Clarence was informed and inspected the volume which turned out to be a Marriage Register in Portuguese for the period 1909 to 1915 and belonged to St. Andrew's. 
<br><br>
Clarence Fernandes remarked "I was long amazed of this gap in the Marriage Register of St. Andrew's." On learning of the find, he obtained a letter of authority from the then Parish Priest, Fr. Peter Drego, and retrieved the volume. It has been returned to its proper place among the other Marriage Registers.
