<h3>The Individual and Citizens Groups in Good Governance</h3>

<i>George Menezes</i><br><br>
Day after day Indians confront a government that is seen as intrusive, bossy, ineffective and corrupt.
<br><br>
Therefore there is one persistent message in India's many elections over the last few decades. And the message is "throw the bums out ".  Indians get easily disillusioned by incumbents.  Most Indians dislike their governments and keep voting in a new bunch of politicians in the hope that they will finally fix everything.
<br><br>
That is probably why we say that "God created mothers because you cannot rely on the government to do everything" Or for that matter, anything.
<br><br>
If we look around us we would discover that not only mothers but a whole lot of other people are pushing government towards better governance, and in some cases, even replacing the Government as a last resort.
<br><br>
Let us take the most publicised event in recent Indian history.  The Gujarat riots. It was inspiring to witness the hundreds of individuals, NGOs and other institutions that, shamed by the horror of what had happened, galvanized themselves to protesting openly and vehemently against the actions of the State Government and courageously provided succor to the refugee camps.
<br><br>
The role of Fr. Cedric Prakash, Teesta Setalvad and Malika Sarabhai, Rohit Prajapati and others, Muslims and many Hindus, has been exemplary and inspiring.
<br><br>
Yet nothing happened.  So the protests and demonstrations changed their focus from the State to the Centre.  Again nothing happened.  The next step was to move the Courts.  It took hard work and a lot of sacrifice and a lot of exposure to danger to finally get justice from the Supreme Court. All this quietly, persistently and in a manner that would have pleased the tallest amongst the Gujaratis, namely Mahatma Gandhi. 
<br><br>
Nearer home in Mumbai, civic society is playing an effective role.  The number of individuals and NGOs breathing down the neck of the government and the Corporation is truly legion.  I will quote several examples.
<br><br>
Take my friend Hyginus D'Lima. He single-handedly fought several noise polluters in Andheri where he lives.  Music, blaring from the mosques and from the night long "dandia ras‚Äù celebrations, was causing great distress to the sick and aged and even to the dogs in the area.  A long and arduous battle in the various Courts resulted in a ruling that has dealt a severe blow to noise pollution.
<br><br>
Let me tell you the story of another friend.  The story is about Jennifer D'Souza.  An unauthorised construction above her flat resulted in water leakages in the centre of her sitting-room.  No amount of visits, petitions and protests got her any relief.  So she decided to go to Court.  
<br><br>
To her great amazement of all her friends, the Court, getting no response from the Municipal Commissioner, issued an order "attaching the Commissioner's office furniture".
<br><br>
 The Commissioner was so embarrassed that he initiated action against the Head of his legal department.  There is no leakage now in Jennifer D'Souza's sitting-room.
<br><br>
The individual, organized citizens and the Judiciary, it would seem, is replacing the Government 
<br><br>
Years ago when I moved from the rarefied atmosphere of Malabar Hill to Bandra the urge to join citizens in protecting this beautiful suburb from the devastation caused by builders, land grabbers, slumlords and hawkers became an overriding priority. 
<br><br>
Today every area in our Municipal Ward has set up an ALM or an Advance Locality Management group.  These ALMs have regular meetings with the Assistant Commissioner of the Corporation and with the Police. It is amazing the kind of results that have been obtained. Inspite of mafia-organized violence against people like Anandini Thakur and Edwin Britto illegal structures, they protested against, have been razed to the ground 
<br><br>
Roads are being resurfaced, storm water drains repaired and restored, gutters thoroughly cleansed. There is a love-hate, husband-wife relationship between bureaucrats and citizens. Politicians are not only envious of this relationship but are doing their best to destroy it. It will not be easy. Citizen power has come to stay and the Assembly elections are around the corner.  
<br><br>
We also see citizen's organisations and other NGOs literally taking over areas where the Corporation and the government has totally abdicated their responsibilities.
<br><br>
Parks and gardens are being taken over and are being maintained by Citizen Groups and NGOs and Corporations. Private watchmen are being appointed to prevent garbage dumping and hawker intrusion into residential areas.  Competitions have been organised. And Roads vie with each other in cleanliness and beautification.
<br><br>
The entire seafront of West Bandra has been taken over by two Citizen groups and has been developed into promenades that are the envy of other Wards Mumbai. These promenades are completely maintained and run by the citizens.  And what is most amazing is that the Corporation, Collectorate and the Maritime Board are quite content to stand back and enjoy the benefits of the community's hard work.
<br><br>
In Mumbai I would single out the path breaking work of AGNI (Action for Good Governance), CitiSpace an organisation for protection of open spaces, VOTE (Voice of the Exploited) and Dignity Foundation an organisation for senior citizens. Not to mention the Bandra West Residents Association and the H West Ward Residents Trust.
<br><br>
I believe that the new government at the Centre has recognised the tremendous effort individuals, citizen groups, private institutions and NGOs have contributed in the area of human rights and in the protection of our environment.  It is in recognition of this, that well-known individuals and heads of NGOs have been invited to join the Central Government's newly constituted Boards. Citizen power is here to stay!
