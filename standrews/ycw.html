<H2><B>The Young Christian Workers Movement </B></H2>
<P align=justify>The Young Christian workers movement is an International 
movement started by a Cardinal Joseph Cardijn in 1912 in Belgium. By 1965 the 
movement had spread across the world even in our very own city of in Bombay. The 
unit started at that time is still in operation at Sankli street, 
Byculla.<BR><BR>The movement primarily takes up issues that concern the working 
person like you and me. We have not been able to make an impact but are able to 
make a difference by the programmes we organise and the issues we take 
up.<BR><BR>Cardijn wanted the youth to develop their own philosophy of the 
"Christian Humanism of the workers." With this in mind the YCW in Mumbai has 
developed it's objectives of <B>Service, Education and 
Representation</B>.<BR><BR>Cardijn encouraged the workers by helping them to 
educate themselves through group discussions that would lead to a formation of 
life and joint action. He summarised his method in the words <B>See, Judge and 
Act</B>. This meant that by group reflection the laity should change their 
lives, their working environment and motivate their colleagues to work towards 
that end. This method of See, Judge and Act is still followed by the YCW 
today.<BR><BR>In the Mumbai Archdiocese, we have a presence in only 24 Parishes 
either at the central level or as units in SCCs. These units organise programmes 
as proposed by the executive committee or as per their local need. We do not 
charge any membership fees for joining the YCW.<BR><BR><B>We have :</B><BR>
<OL>1. Organised signature campaigns to make employment a fundamental right of 
  every citizen which has been forwarded to the International Labour 
  Organisation and the Prime Minister of India. <BR>2. Conducted awareness 
  programmes and signature campaigns on the detrimental effects of the changes 
  in the labour laws.<BR>3. Awareness programmes on the Christian Marriage Bill 
  2001 and it's effects.<BR>4. Awareness programmes tax and how to save your 
  invest wisely.<BR>5. How to face an Interview.<BR>6. Hepatitis-B vaccination 
  programmes.<BR>7. Stress management and stress relief.<BR>8. Time management. 
  <BR></OL><BR><B>At the diocesan level we have :</B> A bi-monthly newsletter 
titled <B>'Realities'</B> that carries information and analysis on current 
issues and creates awareness amongst the YCW members and others.<BR><BR>The 
<B>Employment Network</B>, which pools our resources across the archdiocese in 
terms of vacancies for jobs and job applications.<BR><BR>A group of YCW 
intellectuals that reflect on current issues and formulates a response and 
proposes an action plan aptly called the <B>Think Tank Review and Action 
Group.</B><BR><BR>Through these various programmes and projects, we train our 
members in leadership techniques and personality development to enable them to 
take on the challenges of the work scenario and become responsible citizens, 
able to stand up for their rights and make a difference in their places of 
work.<BR><BR>To find out more and to be part of this movement we invite you to 
our meetings at Room No.4 on the 1st, 3rd &amp; 5th Sunday of the month at 11AM.
