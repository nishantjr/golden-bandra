<h3>Bosco Hall</h3>
The Bosco Hall is perhaps synonomous with the Bosco Club, the organisation
formed under the vicarship of Fr V. Dyer in 1944. The initial focus was to
provide an environment to promote recreational activity for the parish
youth. The building adjacent to the church had just been vacated by the
girls section of St Andrew's High School and the upper floor was allocated
to house the Bosco Club. From sports activities the focus included social
and literary activities. One activity that the Bosco Club can view with
justifiable pride today is the Andrean Talent Contest, or Zonals. This
annual activity has helped foster the awesome talent in our parish that year
after year,  through more than five decades has thrown up professional
musical and dramatic performances that has entertained thousand of people
from our parish and from all over the city. The Bosco Club continues to
foster various talents and groups today, and as in the case of the Zonals,
the organisational skills fostered in the process have proved to be as vital
a gain as the activities organised themselves. Today the Bosco Club
activities are handled by the Communication Cell under Fr Adrian Phillips.
