<br />
My dear Luty,<br />
        Just a few lines to inform you that we are all<br />
keeping well and on the 26th Jany the whole family<br />
went out for a picnic at Versova and I expect<br />
Lourdes and Aubert have given you the full details<br />
as I had asked them to write to you last week.<br />
Fr Roque had arranged for a bus from Bombay<br />
which arrived here at 8.15 A.M..and about 30 of DLP’s<br />
family pushed in merrily singing as they started.<br />
We reached Versova at about 9 A.M. and immediately<br />
set up for breakfast each one looking up for a<br />
cup of tea as MariBranco<span

But anyhow Dedic managed to get kimado<span

for dinner which was at about 2.30 P.M.<br />
as all had been for a stroll. We had a<br />
nice open place behind the Church and in front<br />
of the Parochial house and consequently had<br />
to invite the vicar to join us for dinner.<br />
After tea at about 6 P.M. we left and had a drive<br />
to Bombay and halted at Warden Road</div>

<br />
</span></span> - and<br />
returned home at about 8.30 P.M.<br />
Now that you are in Madras you must be very<br />
busy setting your school and new house<br />
Both Wilfred and Denis go to school and<br />
Bernadette just about 20 months makes<br />
about 20 trips during the day and jabbers away<br />
something which no one can understand.<br />
I am sorry Ita is in bed since Sunday noon<br />
with her old complaint of the leg and fever<br />
and hope she gets out of bed soon. The rest all<br />
keeping well and trust this will find you very<br />
very active. Our new Vicar Fr Henry has changed our<br />
XII hours adoration to 5th Febry, enrollment of Bandra<br />
to Christ the King instead of Pentecost Sunday - and the<br />
procession to St Andrew’s School and back to Church<br />
instead of Mount Mary’s<br />
Fr Eddy Fernandes becomes the Rector of Mount Marty’s.<br />
With love and kind regards,<br />
                                      yoursaffectionately<br />
