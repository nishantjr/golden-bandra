      <p>Two questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Why did the Portuguese come to India?</li>
<li>How did they manage to establish such strong beach heads so
soon?</li>
</ol>
<p>A search for “spices and souls” is Portuguese endeavor in the East
has been commonly described. While the spice trade was a strong
motivation, conversion was hardly a driving force. In fact, the
Portuguese were almost totally ignorant of what they were going to find
in India. What they were actually hoping to find were allies in their
on-going fight against the “moors’ which was the their generic name for
muslims, which for them was the Fatimid dynasty of Egypt. <em>In fact,
there was an even more potent muslim power which had already risen in
the East, the Ottoman who would soon become their principal
enemy.</em></p>
<p>Portugal and Spain at the time were still riding the triumphal wave
of the reconquisita when they finally conquered the last of the
Arab-Berber muslim kingdoms which had reigned in the Iberian peninsula
for seven centuries. Both countries, not satisfied with clearing their
homeland of the invaders had followed them to the African mainland and
were trying to establish their own outposts there.</p>
<p>b which they and believed tayht there was a Christian Kingdom ruled
by a legendary king Prester John to the south of their muslim
enemies,which at the time was principally the Fatimid dynasty in Egypt.
Their goal was a grand strategic alliance with Prester John which would
squeeze the muslims from the south while they attacked from the
west.</p>
<p>They knew nothing of India and Hinduism and their only knowledge of
religions other than Christianity was Islam. In fact when they first saw
hindu temples with the statues of the gods and goddesses they thought
they were some kind of Christian sect.</p>
<p>Portugals initial foray into India was not at all promising . Vasco
da Gama did not make much of an impression on his first visit.
Portuguese “foreigh trade relations’ had been only with the minor
principalities on the African west coast and the gifts and trading goods
on their first trip were treated with amusement and even contempt by the
Zamorin in Calicut. However, their armed ships which had no match among
the IIndian navies of the time gave them a great competititve edge which
they utilized to the full.</p>
