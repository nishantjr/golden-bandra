This website aims to recover the content from the Golden Bandra website.
We do not focus one exactly replicating the site,
(more appropriate for archive.org's [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20161021165321/http://www.goldenbandra.com/)).
but instead on making the content available and accessible for the modern web.
