Lines on the East Indian Community Today
========================================

## The present position of the community, their origins and the adoption of their name

The East Indians today can broadly be viewed in two groups. A large proportion
are 'urbanised', living in localities situated between Mumbai and Vasai. Most of
these localities are the original villages where the East Indians resided as
well as adjacent areas. Another significant group of East Indians today lives in
a less urban environment in places like Chaul, Korlai, and north, up to Dahanu,
though even including places like Uttan and Gorai. The residents here have had
fewer educational and other advantages available, compared with their
urban-based counterparts, that would have enabled them to advance.

As a society becomes more cosmopolitan demographic identities merge. The
integrity of nations, tribes societies and communities is dependent on
insularity. Once travel and communication become easier cultural and ethnic
mixing results. This is an inevitable process. What is today a recognizable
community may in a few generations be irreversibly dispersed. So too with
communities like the East Indians. Besides, this small group of people had
coalesced into a community a little more than a century ago, in response to
specific common needs and pressures. The situation today is different.

## Some historical background

The group of people calling themselves East Indians share some common features,
geographically, historically and culturally. They are the descendents of the
original inhabitants of the regions that were ruled at different times by the
Maharattas, Portuguese and British. The territories extended from Dahanu in the
north to Chaul and Korlai in Ratnagiri in the south.

These people in 'Northern' territories were distinct from Goa both politically
and culturally. Their forests and quarries provided much of the timber and
basalt stone used to build up Goa. Agriculturally too the region was very
prosperous and provided valuable revenue. The influence of the Portuguese church
authorities was much less in these areas than it was in Goa. Hence the people
essentially retained their cultural heritage in matters of food, dress, marriage
customs, language etc. These were very similar to their Hindu forebears and
neighbours. Which is a point made by East Indians today who are the 'asli
Mumbaikars' with a rich heritage that goes back centuries.

With the coming of the Portuguese from the 16th century there were major changes
that took place. The area was divided into 'Aldeas' with landlords appointed by
the Portuguese crown. For instance Aldemar, a name still in use in the area,
meaning 'Aldea-by-the-sea'.

It was the custom to award land for limited periods to military officers who had
distinguished themselves in the service of the King. Thus Bandra was granted in
the 16th century to Antonio Pessoa, who had fought with valour in Diu and
Bassein. After his death it passed on to his widow. Following her death Bandra
was given to the Jesuits. By the early 1600s Bandra was almost entirely
Christian.

In those days the people in the region were prosperous and the standard of
living was good. Fr Gomes Vaz, writing in 1576 says: "Bandra is a very fine
Village". " This island is very fruitful and the land is very fresh. The island
is called Salsette as the land of Goa with a difference that the latter is not
an island", referring to the Salcette of Goa. And an English visitor, John Fryer
who visited Bandra in 1673-75 writes: " The town is large and houses tiled; it
is called Bandura... In the middle of the river we had a pleasant prospect on
both sides; on Bandura side, the College, the town, the Church of St Andrew a
mile beyond, and upon the hill that pointed to the sea, and Aguada, block-house,
and a Church; on the other side the Church of Mahim, and other handsome
buildings". And writing about Salsette Island, "the ground excellently fertile
either of itself or by the care of the Inhabitants, that it yields as good
Cabbages, Coleworts, and better Rhadishes than ever I yet saw: Besides Garden -
Fruit, here are incomparable Water-Melons, and Onions as sweet, and as well
tasted as an Apple; and for the natural growth of the Soil, it is known not only
to supply the adjoining Islands, but Goa also. It is more than 20 Miles in
Length and 70 in Circumference".

Through the years the region was governed by the Marathas, Portuguese and the
British and the community adjusted to the various changes. Even after the
Maratha conquests around 1739 the Christians in the region were allowed some
freedom to practise their Faith. Many priests had to leave the area. Over time
some communities dwindled or disappeared, for instance Magthane and Kondita.
Others continued with local priests and people taking the lead. Many parishes
and communities developed a certain 'independence' therefore. There were local
confraternities with a sense of ownership over churches or traditional
celebrations and rites that were in constant tussles with parish priests and
church authorities.

With the coming of the British there were significant added influences on the
community.

## The adoption of the name

The name, East Indian was adopted in 1887, the year of the Golden Jubilee of
Queen Victoria who ruled India at the time. In that year the leaders of the
community held three public meetings, in Mazagaon, Andheri and Papdy, Bassein in
order to convince the people that they needed to band together for the general
good. This led to the formation of the 'Bombay East Indian Association' and the
adoption of the name 'East Indian'. There has been speculation about the
specific reason for choosing the name 'East Indian'.

There were various reasons and pressures that led to the adoption of this name,
among them were the desire to identify themselves as descendants of the original
inhabitants of the region who were loyal British subjects.

Another reason was that the community wished to identify itself as distinct from
the many other Christian immigrants with similar surnames who were increasingly
coming into Bombay and coming into competition with the community for jobs and
employment. These other Christians were chiefly from Goa, Mangalore etc.

## Loyal subjects

One of the first actions was the formation of the Bombay East Indian Association
and the adoption of the name East Indian. Certainly part of their objective was
to identify themselves as loyal British subjects. The Portuguese were seen as
being mainly interested in seeking 'spices, silver and souls' and not being very
concerned about the education and advancement of their colonial subjects. Prior
to this the East Indians were referred to as Portuguese Christians, Native
Christians, Native Portuguese, Norteiros - this referring to their geographic
location north of Goa, and Portuguese Roman Catholic British subjects and these
terms were not acceptable hence the change of name.

## Differentiation from other peoples

Starting from the early decades of the 19th century the economic success of the
British in India resulted in the trickle of immigrants from Goa to Bombay
becoming a flood. There were also influxes from other regions like Mangalore
etc. In 1780 the population of Bombay was around 100,000. In the 1850's this
number had increased to 500,000. As conditions in Goa deteriorated further the
flow of immigrants increased greatly. This was facilitated by the improvements
in transport and communication by coastal ferry steamers and the establishment
of the railway system. This resulted in more pressures on the indigenous
Christians.

## The Padroado - Propaganda issue

A condition existing at the time that had great relevance to the lives of the
people was the Padroado jurisdiction whereby the Portuguese controlled the
churches in the area, not including Bombay Island, where the churches were under
the control of the Propaganda Fide, in Rome. The kings of Portugal were invested
by the Popes in the 15th and 16th centuries, with the right of Patronage called
Padroado. This allowed the Portuguese complete control over churches and church
affairs in all their territories and in India even in areas that were later
governed by the British. The Portuguese were seen as regarding their churches as
generators of money to be sent back to Portugal. Beyond this they had little
desire to develop the areas and neglected the education and growth of the
population. By the 17th century, Rome felt that Padroado was not doing enough
for the conversion of the native population under their control and so it set up
the Congregation of Propaganda Fide in 1622. From that time onwards Propaganda
missionaries were sent to India. Later, in 1720, Portuguese-born priests were
expelled from Bombay by the British and the churches of Bombay were entrusted to
the Propaganda Apostolate. The difference between the Padroado areas and the
Propaganda areas in Bombay, where there were many more educational institutions
and the people had many more opportunities for education, employment and
advancement and hence were more prosperous, was evident. To add to this, the
clergy in the Padroado churches, appointed from Goa, naturally favoured Goan
immigrants in the parishes and this aggravated the original inhabitants who felt
discriminated against. In Bandra the Padroado Propaganda split resulted in a
situation where St Andrew's and later Mount Carmel were Padroado churches owing
allegiance to Portugal and St Peter's was administered by the Propaganda Fide in
Rome. People were allowed to choose their parish regardless of geographical
logic so that a family residing by the side of St Andrew's could be parishioners
of St Peter's and would have their marriages and burials there instead on at the
neighbouring St Andrew's. In Propaganda churches and schools English education
was the norm, e.g.., St Xavier's In Bombay and St Stanislaus' in Bandra while
Portuguese was the language preferred in Padroado schools like St Andrew's.

In an effort to resolve this situation, where the community found itself at a
disadvantage there were many protests and representations made. The quality of
the protest as judged from the extensive correspondence on file between East
Indian community local leaders and the ecclesiastical authorities in Rome and
the English authorities in London speaks of a highly educated cadre of East
Indian leaders.

In 1887 when the name was adopted there was a feeling of being discriminated
against that was to a significant extent due to the fact that much of the clergy
were from Goa, owing allegiance to the Padroado faction. Thus they were seen as
favouring Goan immigrants to the Bombay area to the detriment of the indigenous
people.

Ultimately an agreement in 1928 put an end to the right of patronage outside of
Portuguese territories in India and amalgamated all the churches under the
archdioceses of Bombay. Before this amalgamation the Catholic archdiocese of
Bombay had 36360 souls in 1928 and to this was added 93,692 persons from the old
diocese of Damaun. Secular priests increased by almost 300% to a total of 125.
With regard to schools the Propaganda diocese had 109 schools before the
agreement to which the Padroado added 58 more.

The Woodstock Letters
=====================

The members of the Society of Jesus of the United States tell their fascinating
story in the pages of The Woodstock Letters, a journal published from 1872 to
1969 at the Jesuits' Woodstock, Maryland, scholasticate. The Woodstock Letters
is one of the most extensive and literate sources for Jesuit information in
existence, providing access to scholarly historical and biographical essays
related to Catholic history; contemporary reports from Rome and from parishes,
schools, and universities in the United States; and obituaries, book reviews,
and more.

The following letter is from the Woodstock Letters and written by Fr Herbert
Parker, and American Jesuit posted in Bandra at St Stanislaus', who later became
Principal of the institution.

___________________________________
LETTER FROM FATHER H. PARKER, ST. STANISLAUS', BANDRA, August 22, 1916 ; From the Athenaeum Library, Pune, January 2006

DEAR FATHER EDITOR; P.C.


St Stanislaus  (In the year 1916)
It would amuse you to see the latest reader of the LETTERS. He is a little boy, 13 years of age, and small for his years, his feet not touching the floor as he sits, but with the voice of a man, and an expression in his reading that would do credit to many a one older and long experienced in refectory efforts.
Our school is on Salsette Island, just north of Bombay Island. This is not the island on which our martyrs, Blessed Rudolph Aqunviva and Companions suffered; that is near the city of Goa. We are on the southern part of the island, in Bandra, a little town that with the surrounding villages, numbers about 25,000 souls. Our school was originally an orphanage, like St. Mary's, Bombay, but now it has the more dignified name of “Institution', though we still have some eighty or ninety orphans. St. Mary's has almost as many, but ours are discalceated, while those at St. Mary's are not, and would not like to be known as orphans
Of all our schools in the mission, we are the best off here as regards the teaching staff, and we have next to the largest community. Before the war there were some seven or eight German Fathers here, one or two scholastics and several Brothers. Now we have a community of ten: five Jesuit Fathers, two Brothers and three secular priests. Our superior is a Swiss, 76 years of age
For seventy-five years of his life he considered himself a German, but when the order came to intern the German Fathers, previous to expatriation, or repatriation, he had the matter looked into, and discovered that he was a Swiss by birth. There are two Portuguese Fathers, who were working in the Madras mission, and came here last September. They are hampered somewhat in their work because of an imperfect knowledge of English. One young Jesuit Father is a native of Singapore He also came last fall (speaking in American terms) with the two Portuguese Fathers, and a native Brother. Another Brother, a Portuguese from near Goa, came three months ago. The secular priests are a Eurasian, a native of Agra, who teaches in the school, a young native of Bandra, who is the prefect of the second division, and another native priest, of the vicinity, who is the pastor of the native Christians. So you see we are a rather mosaic-like community, but we all get along very well together, and have enough men for the work. We have a number of efficient lay teachers, men and women, all of whom have been here for years, and have teachers' certificates for good work done or for successful examinations passed.
We have about 525 boys here. At one time, there were over 700, but we were overcrowded then, and the Government Inspectors were not as strict as they are now. About 300 of the boys are day scholars, and 220 boarders, of whom about 40 are in the 'first class', 60 in the second class, and the remainder are third class boarders or orphans. 
Fee Structure
It may be interesting to know our tuition and boarding rates, to compare them with Holy Cross or Loyola School. I shall give you the items from our prospectus: 
Terms for first class boarders: 
Entrance fee Prep and first to fourth Standard, 	2 rupees; 
*fourth to sixth Standard (inclusive), 	3 rupees. 
Boarding fee—monthly 	18 rupees. 
School fee - Prep and first Standard, 	one rupee monthly; 
second and third Standard, 	1½ : rupees monthly; 
fourth and fifth Standard, 	3 rupees monthly; 
sixth Standard, 	3 rupees monthly. 
Dhobie (laundry-man) and tailors, 	1½ rupees, half-yearly.
Terms for second class boarders: 	12 rupees per month. 
All other fees the same as for first class boarders. 
Terms for third class boarders are not advertised; they are from 8 rupees per month down. 
They eat with the orphans; the other classes each have separate tables. 
The school fees for the day scholars are: 	from 2 to 5 rupees monthly. 
Reductions are expected and frequently given. (*A rupee is about 32 cents; 'Exchange rate in 1916'). 

You can readily imagine, from these rates, that the table-fare is not very varied nor delicate; but it is substantial enough, and better than the boys are accustomed to at home. For the orphans and third class boarders it consists chiefly of rice and meat curry, with bread, coffee, and an occasional banana. This is all they are used to, and “where ignorance is bliss, 'tis folly to be wise”. To feed, clothe and lodge a boy for 8 rupees, or 2 dollars and 60 cents a month, sounds rather strange to American ears, but it can be done here in India. 
Of course, not much money is spent on shoes and other luxuries of life. The scriptural principle, “Take up your bed and walk”, is exemplified here daily. Only a very few, even of the first class boarders, have mattresses; a pillow and a blanket are sufficient for a good night's rest. No sheets are necessary, only night trunks. We can get a good many more boys in a dormitory here than you can in America. Thank goodness, we have no social uplifters here to pry into the affairs of our institutions.
School matters
Our school is a primary and secondary school, taking boys up to, and through the sixth standard, which is the same as our second year high school. We teach the usual preparatory and high school matter, beginning Latin in the fourth standard, and the boys do pretty well.
The boys are very easy to manage; they are not much given to tricks, like American boys, and deep-laid schemes are quite unheard of. Their bare legs are very convenient for the use of the cane, which is very common. There is a very good spirit between the boys and the teachers. There are about thirty-five 'non-Christian', day scholars, who attend our school, Hindus, Mahometans and Parsees. They keep their caps on in class, and also when they come into your room, as this is a sign of respect. 
They are excused from religious instruction, and no efforts are made to convert them. I may say here that this is one of the secrets of the success of our German Fathers here, especially in the beginning of the mission. When we took up the mission in the Bombay Presidency, Catholics had a very poor standing. Education was the thing to begin with. Now, the Catholic people could not support schools and colleges themselves, so we had to invite all, Christian and non-Christian; and to get wealthy 'non-Christian' parents to send their children to our schools, we had to make them realize that there was no fear of our endeavoring to convert them. Now the work has been done; Catholics are respected, there is a good spirit between the natives and ourselves generally, and our schools are the leading ones of their kind, and are acknowledged as such. I am told that this is the same principle that is being followed out in our new mission of Japan. On the way over, on the boat, I heard from several gentlemen words of high praise of our colleges in Bombay; and the same can be said of the schools of our other missions in other parts of India.
Government aid
All our schools receive generous government aid. The government gives one-third and in some cases one-half towards the erection of school buildings. A grant of one-third is also given on school expenditure, a drawing grant is also given, and there is a fixed annual grant up to 10000 rupees. St. Xavier's College and High School get the largest possible grant; we get 7,945 rupees here. This amount goes a great way in India.
The grant must not be more than one-third of the annual expenses of the school, and in the list of annual expenses we count in the nominal salary of the religious teachers, which is a high one. The Head master, e.g. is allowed 350 rupees monthly, and the other Jesuit fathers teaching, from 300-300 rupees. We get a grant of eight rupees monthly for twenty Eurasian orphans, just about enough to support them. St. Mary's gets a similar grant for about sixty.
There is an annual inspection of every school, and very exact and searching accounts must be handed in from time to time. Our school year begins in June, and we leave a month free in October and May, besides the Christmas and Easter holidays.
So much for our school. We have also a Gujerati school in our parish for the children of our sweepers and other servants. It would never do to have the low-caste children in school with the others. The children are instructed there in their own native dialects, Gujerati or Mahratti. There are no benches in the school, as in the other native village schools; the children sit on the floor, tailor-fashion, just as they do always in their own homes, even when they take their meals. There are several village parish schools in Bandra, and several government aided schools, but none of them can be compared with our own in any respect.

The East Indian Community
Herman Rodrigues and Denis Rodrigues  
The present position of the community,  origins and the adoption of their name
The East Indians today can broadly be viewed in two groups. The majority of them are 'urbanised', living in localities situated between Mumbai and Vasai. Most of these localitles are the original villages where the East Indians resided as well as adjacent areas. 
Another, significant group of East Indians today live in a less urban environment in places like Chaul, Korlai, and north up to Dahanu, though even including places like Uttan and Gorai. The residents here have had fewer educational and other advantages, available compared with their urban-based counterparts, that would have enabled them to advance.
Some historical background
The group of people calling themselves East Indians share some common features, geographically, historically and culturally. They are the descendents of the original inhabitants of the regions that were ruled at various times by the Marathas, Portuguese and British. The territories extended from Dahanu in the North to Chaul and Korlai in Raigad District to the south.
These people and the 'Northern' territories were distinct from Goa both politically and culturally. Their forests and quarries provided much of the timber and basalt stone used to build up Goa. Agriculturally too the region was very prosperous and provided valuable revenue. The influence of the Portuguese church authorities was much less in these areas than it was in Goa. Hence the people essentially retained their cultural heritage in matters of dress, marriage customs, language etc. These were very similar to their Hindu forebears and neighbours. Which is a point made by East Indians today who are the 'asli Mumbaikars' with a rich heritage that goes back centuries.
With the coming of the Portuguese from the 16th century there were major changes that took place. The area was divided into 'Aldeas' with  landlords appointed by the Portuguese crown. For instance Aldemar, Aldea-by-the-sea, a name still used in the area.
Land was awarded to military officers who had distinguished themselves in the service of the King. Thus Bandra was granted in the 16th century to Antonio Pessoa, who had fought with valour in Diu and Bassein. After his death it passed on to his widow. After her death Bandra was given to the Jesuits. By the early 1600s Bandra was almost entirely Christian. In those days the people in the region were prosperous and the standard of living was good. Fr Gomes Vaz, writing in 1576 says:
“Bandra is a very fine Village”. “ This island is very fruitful and the land is very fresh. The island is called Salsette as the land of Goa with a difference that the latter is not an island”, referring to the Salcette of Goa. And an English visitor, John Fryer who visited Bandra in 1673-75 writes: “ The town is large and houses tiled; it is  called Bandura...”  And this about the island of  Salsette, “the ground excellently fertile either of itself or by the care of the Inhabitants, that it yields as good Cabbages, Coleworts, and better
Rhadishes than ever I yet saw: Besides Garden - Fruit, here are incomparable Water-Melons, and Onions as sweet, and as well tasted as an Apple; and for the natural growth of the Soil, it is known not only to supply the adjoining Islands, but Goa also. It is more than 20 Miles in Length and 70 in Circumference”.
After the conquest by the Marathas in 1739 , the area and people who would later call themselves East Indians had to face some hard times. Though they were allowed some freedom to practise their Faith, most of the priests had to leave. Over time some communities dwindled or disappeared, for instance Magthane and Kondita. Others continued with local priests and people taking the lead. Many parishes and communities developed a certain 'independence' therefore. And this later translated into the local confraternities who both felt and exercised a great deal of responsibility and authority in the traditional celebrations and rites which resulted in numerous tussles with parish priests and church authorities.
Economically too, the area suffered badly and by the time the British took over in 1774 much of the land was no longer cultivated and had reverted to wilderness. 
With the coming of the British there were significant added influences on the community. The British did more than the Portuguese to develop the region and promoted commerce. It soon became a vital advantage to be educated and fluent in English in order to advance professionally as well as socially. 
The adoption of the name
The community formally adopted the name East Indian in 1887 , in response to a perceived need to identify themselves as the descendants of the original inhabitants of the region and as a strategy in local religious politics, but which also had socio-cultural and political overtones. The issue was whether the local churches should be administered by the Church authorities in Goa or directly from Rome . And this struggle had a history going back to the time of the East India Company when the British first took over the area from the Marathas and even before that in the Island of Bombay.
In the Portuguese times, the Christians in the area were under the authority of the Church in Goa. But after the Marathas conquered the land, this was no longer possible and the religious needs were met through the church in Bombay which was quite independent of the authorities in Goa . After the British took over, they were initially wary of the Portuguese political ambitions and therefore didn't allow them any religious jurisdiction in the area. But by 1786, when relations between England and Portugal improved, the Portuguese asked that they be allowed to once again regain control of the local churches. This in turn led to a division in the local Christian community with some wanting “ to revert back to the jurisdiction of Goa and other vehmenetly opposed to this. In 1790 the decision was taken by the local English authorities to give Goa full jurisdiction but a group appealed against the decision to the East India Court of Directors in London who stayed the order. It was at this time, that the dissidents no longer accepted the name of “Portuguese Christians' and put their hopes in the East India Company to sever the old links with Goa. Eventually there was a compromise and a religious Double Jurisdiction was put into place which lasted for almost another hundred years. 
The struggle however continued and even intensified and one of the main issues was that of education. The areas under British control had English schools and generally were much more progressive than those under Portuguese influence and things came to a head in 1887. In that year the leaders of the community held three public meetings, in Mazagaon, Andheri and Papdy, Bassein in order to convince the people that they needed to band together for the general good. One of the first actions was the formation of the Bombay East Indian Association and the formal adoption of the name East Indian. And to proclaim this more effectively a Newspaper, the Bombay East Indian, was started, which incidentally is still published as a monthly journal.
The quality of the protest, starting from the late 1800s to the 1920s, as judged from the correspondence on file between East Indian community local leaders and the ecclestiacal authorities in Rome and the English authorities in London speaks of a highly educated cadre of East Indian leaders and it is seems very probable that they were aware of the early history of the struggle for 'religious independence' and hence took the name of East Indian as a symbol of their first era of freedom !. 
East Indians today
The average East Indian today in general may no longer be aware of the origins of the name and perhaps is not very concerned about it either. As a society becomes more cosmopolitan demographic identities merge. The integrity of nations, tribes societies and communities is dependent on insularity. Once travel and communication become easier cultural and ethnic mixing results. This is an inevitable process. What is today a recognizable community may in a few generations be irreversibly dispersed. So too with communities like the East Indians and the other Christian communities in particular and the population in general. Today the Christian community is so homogeneous that it is difficult to distinguish one ethnic group from an other. And this is a process that will continue. The value of communities like the East Indians of western India will perhaps be in the legacy of historical, religious and sociological detail that they leave behind.

Lines on the EI Community today ...
Rice was the staple food of the community and is grown throughout the region. A large part of the year was spent in activities centred around the cultivation of rice. 
Preparations of the fields usually start well before the rains. The earthen mounds, or baandhs, around the paddy fileds, that serve to retain the rain water are repaired using clods of mud dug from alongside the fields.The nursery is generally a small plot on a higher part of the land. Here the seedlings are raised. Approximately 3-4 weeks later the seedlings are uprooted and transplanted.  As the plants grow and flower, the standing water is reduced and towards the end a few heavy showers at the time the grain is ripening, ensures a good harvest. 
The threshed rice is winnowed by pouring it from a supra, a shallow tray made of thin bamboo slats, on a windy day. The collected grain is then stored in huge earthen jars in the veranda or on the loft. The paddy is dehusked either by using a grinding stone or in the local village rice mill.
Aguera - Thanksgiving for a good harvest
This is the ceremony that takes place before the harvest - it is a ritual blessing of the standing, ripened paddy. Though often done in the church nowadays, it used to involve a formal procession, sometimes carrying a statue of Our Lady on a palinquin to the fields. Symbolic sheaves of paddy are cut and placed at the base of the statue as an offering. 
The harvest festival is celebrated by Salsette Christians. Other groups have a few stalks blessed by a priest and these are often seen tied above the main entrance doors of the houses.
The origin of the term Aguera is uncertain but thought to derive from fogueira  the old Portuguese word for a bonfire, which was burned around this time using the winnowed sheaves.

From tjhe Cerlebrate Bandra brochure
Rustic, Ranwar, Runaway, Ranoar, Ramshackle, Ranvar
Quaint and picturesque, with a flavour of yesterday that may not be there tomorrow
Clarence Fernandes, Herman Rodrigues & Denis Rodrigues


Navigating the permanent traffic jam that is Hill Road today, visitors to Bandra might be tempted to escape life-and-limb threatening traffic by using a sleepy, narrow gully called Langrana Lane that takes off to the south of 'Hill Road' near the Holy Family Hospital. And if they did so, they would suddenly find themselves in a different world.  Old style cottages and double storeyed buildings with red 'Mangalore' tiles on their roofs, along a narrow road that seems to wind erratically to dodge the houses located haphazardly, without apparent rhyme or reason. This is Ranwar, one of the original 24 pakhadis that made up Bandra since the earliest documented history in early 1700s. And it has managed to retain its village character even as present-day 'development' has hemmed it in on all sides. 

Ranwar today, is the confusion of houses adjoining a central street, Veronica Street. This narrow lane meanders from Waroda Road in the north, roughly in a southward direction, barely a quarter of a kilometer in length and emerges in the St. Sebastian's Housing Scheme, which in turn abuts on the Bandra Reclamation. The street itself was probably named around 1906-07, when a prominent resident of Ranwar, Peter Pereira, was municipal councillor in what was then the Bandra Municipality.  The reason it is called Veronica Street relates to a traditional Christian tableau held in the season of Lent during Passion Week, depicting the events surrounding the death of Jesus.  In those days, a girl playing the role of Veronica, one of the followers of Christ, was formally dressed in a house in Ranwar and carried on a palanquin in procession to St Andrew Church. 
During the solemn procession, when Christ carried his cross to Calvary, there was an annual re-enactment of the scene that took place about 2000 years ago, when, unable to bear the sight of Christ suffering and staggering under the whips and lances of the Roman soldiers, Veronica approached him with a soothing cloth to wipe his bloody face. In recognition of her courage and compassion, the legend has it, Veronica was left with an image of Christ's face on the cloth she used. This re-enactment is performed even today, though Veronica no longer sallies forth from Ranwar as she once did.

In 1534, Bahadur Shah of Gujarat, who ruled over this area, ceded the coastal tract from Bombay to beyond Bassein, to the Portuguese. This included the island of Salsette, of which Bandra was part. At the time Bandra was composed of 25 pakhadis or hamlets and Ranwar may well have been one of them. In 1548 Bandra along with other places was granted by the Portuguese Crown to Antonio Pesoa and his wife Isabel Botelho for the duration of their lives. By 1568 Antonio Pesoa and Isabel Botelho had both expired and the Portuguese Crown granted Bandra to the Jesuits as a revenue source to support their work. 
In 1583 the first place of public Catholic worship was constructed on the shores of the Mahim creek. It was called Santa Anna. The non-parochial St Andrew was built around 1599-1601. By 1616 the Catholic population was around 6,000 and there was felt the need for another parish in Bandra. The Koli portion of the Bandra Catholic population was assigned to the Church of St Andrew. Ranwar, a pakhadi of cultivators, remained part of the old Santa Anna parish.
As far as preserved historical records are concerned, the earliest reference to Ranwar dates to 1716, pertaining to a birth entry in the Register of the Church of Santa Anna, now kept at St Andrew Church. The residents then were the Pereiras, Fonsecas, Pessoas, Gomes, Gracias, Rodrigues Dias and Gonsalves and others. 
Another prominent family, the Xaviers, were originally Pereiras. The legend has it that in the 1700s the family was travelling to Goa by sea and their boat was caught in a terrible storm. In mortal fear of their lives they fell on their knees and prayed to St Francis Xavier to spare their lives. This duly done, they immediately changed their name from 'Pereira' to 'Xavier' in acknowledgement of the debt they owed the saint.
Notwithstanding this, there was always a predominance of Pereiras in Ranwar. In fact there is still a saying doing the rounds today, among non-Pereiras of course, that if you throw a stone in Ranwar you would hit either a Pereira or a pig. Nowadays though, the Pereiras would be more at risk, since for more than the last forty years, free-range pigs, once a common sight on the streets in villages like Ranwar, are a thing of the past. 
Equally lost in time, are the unforgettable pig-chases, occasions when the animals were chased frantically all over the village, indiscriminately invading gardens and even verandas and crossing roads and culminating in ultimate capture, which was heralded by the ear shattering squeals and grunts of the doomed animal. This event happened a few times each year, especially just before Christmas, Easter and the Bandra Feast, a precursor to the sarpotel, vindaal and delicious sausages that appear on every village table on the feast day. 

In earlier days, the area was mostly given to rice cultivation though there were also extensive vegetable gardens. The region in fact was noted for a special variety of sweet onions, which until recently could be seen hanging in bundles in almost every local kitchen. In addition there were coconut groves along the shore and mango orchards inland, all owned by the Jesuits.
Ranwar itself was a rice-producing village and this can be deduced from the arrangement of the houses in the village. Rice farmers traditionally are loath to waste a good paddy field on building houses. Villages of rice farmers, unlike those of vegetable growers, therefore are invariably built on high ground or on rocky outcrops and perforce are built close to one another with the streets having to thread their way between houses as best they can. Safety was another reason: pirates regularly raided the area because of the rich pickings available. Even today, there are residents who can recall stories told by grandparents about how their parents every so often had to flee to the fields because of reports of marauding bands in the area.
Ranwar was a tenant village of the Jesuits until 1739 when the Portuguese evacuated Bandra and the Marathas took possession of it. In December 1774, the Marathas were ejected by the British who allowed the farmers to become proprietors of the land they cultivated. And very good land it was, both because of its fertility and situation. At the time commerce between the mainland and British Bombay was by ferry from Bandra, which in those days was an important, if minor port, as can be judged by the fort that still exists in part at Land's End. It was also a major access route to Bombay harbour via Sion. (This was when Bombay was still a set of islands and the Sion Causeway didn't exist) 
At that time the port was near where the mosque on S.V. Road now stands and Ranwar was just a farmer's hop step and jump away. Bombay already was a commercial hub and most of rice and vegetable imports were from and through Bandra. This was a golden era for Ranwar judging from the houses that were built at the time. The earliest constructions still standing, date back to those years. 
This situation changed in 1845 when the Mahim Causeway was built and even more in 1867 when the railway line was laid. Beside the loss of trade, siltation due to the causeway and the railway bridge soon made the port unviable. Ranwar was no longer near the 'front door' to Bombay. However, the improved communications made for new opportunities. Job opportunities in Bombay now increased. 
In 1792, Fr Francis de Mello of Povoacao, now D'monte Street, initiated literacy classes in a shed within St Andrew's Church compound. The language of instruction was Portuguese and thus students from Bandra, including Ranwar, which was the closest pakhadi to the Church, became acquainted with the Roman script. 
This familiarity with the Roman script enabled them to learn English, which was a necessity in commercial Bombay. By the second half of the nineteenth century an English medium school, the St Stanislaus institution, had opened. Likewise a girls' school, St Joseph's Convent had commenced classes in 1863. Students who wished to study further and appear for their matriculation, went to Bombay.
Agriculture for many was no longer the main livelihood and this was fortunate because there was now need for alternate use of the land.

A pestilence was recorded in Bandra in 1700, which severely affected cultivation. Later in the nineteenth century epidemics of typhoid, cholera etc are known to have afflicted Bandra. The old villages, with the houses crowded together were death traps. In the closing years of the nineteenth century, the bubonic plague killed hundreds of inhabitants. 
Detailed records of Catholic victims are preserved in the registers of the churches of St Andrew, St Peter and Mount Carmel. Whenever the plague struck, people would flee to the relative safety of temporary shelters in their fields. 
Signs of those times still survive today. At almost every extremity of the village there are religious shrines as a means of obtaining divine protection from the dread disease.  And even today, one of the invocations said during the family Rosary “St Roque and St Sebastian save us from plague and pestilence” bears witness to the very real danger that this affliction posed for villages like Ranwar. 
Because of the frequency of the epidemics, many of the new educated gentry now began building houses in what were once their rice fields to the south of the original village, and this marked the second phase of house construction in the village.

Ranwar has had a very close and active community down the years. The many organisations that were and still are active in the area are witness to that. Around 1924, well before the Bandra Gymkhana started, the Rest Ranwar was founded by a group of Ranwarites. 
The club produced expert badminton, tennis, cricket football and hockey and other sportspeople down the years. It has a small pavilion for indoor activities as well as outdoor playing grounds. The annual Christmas and New Year dances at the 'Rest' as it was popularly known, attracted crowds from all over Bombay.  Today, after being dormant for many years, the Club is being revived once again.
Ranwar was also home to a literary group, called The Varsity Circle, founded by a group of men from Bandra. They conducted debates and held talks on various topics of interest and also produced a magazine. This was handwritten in classic copperplate script, and which was in great demand even outside the circle of members. 
The Varsity Circle was a literary training ground for the members and two of the founders later went on to become principals, one of St John the Baptist High School, Thane and the other of St Teresa's High School, Girgaum. The Varsity Circle encouraged literary, acting and public speaking talent. 
Another founder was the renowned, author and playwright, Arty Pereira or 'Doc', who through the years trained hundred's of students. His book Success in 30 Days written in the 1950s was a best seller when first published (and is still in print). Thirty years after his death, people from all over the country were still writing letters to him, to thank him and to tell of the effect the book has had on their lives.

Any story of Ranwar would be woefully incomplete without mention of the Ranwar Funds.  These are chit funds, the oldest of which, was started more than 150 years ago and which is still running smoothly. There are the seasonal funds meant to provide a lump sum at times of extra expenses. And so there is the Christmas Saving Fund, the Bandra Feast Fund and the Monsoon Fund. And finally there is the Death Benefit Fund, which was once one of the most appreciated. On the day of the death of a member, an envelope would be discreetly handed over to the family to meet the expenses of the funeral.
Besides, the monetary benefits, the chit 'Funds' and groups that have endured for decades, are perhaps the very reason why village communities like Ranwar have been so close knit.  Every year, all the members would gather for an Annual Meeting, which was both business and pleasure. Even today, when the original financial objectives of the Funds hardly matter, membership is full, and often passed on as an inheritance. Annual dinners are well attended and start with the statement of accounts being read, queried and passed after which the mandatory khimaad, a potent, typically East Indian brew, made from 'country' alcohol, tea and spices and drunk piping hot, is served. This is a point in the proceedings that advertises itself to the neighboring residents in no uncertain terms, for after a few sips of khimaad the decibel level of the gathering increases logarithmically. Earlier the country liquor was locally procured, even during the prohibition era, when the area around Ranwar was the source of some of the finest brews in town. 
Perhaps the quaintest of the groups, and something unique to Ranwar, is the 'One-Four Fund'. This, women's group   was started more than 50 years ago. The name derives from the monthly contribution of each member. For years it stayed put at a rupee and four annas. There were 12 members originally and one rupee was for the monthly share, while the four annas was the social contribution, out of which these amazing women produced their sumptuous, monthly dinner. Every home cooked dinner is a gourmet's delight.  Membership was in such demand that membership was expanded to 24. Even when the women move out of Ranwar, they still retain membership. There is a waiting list for new members with special rights for a child of a deceased member. 
The village today, like all the other heritage villages in Bandra is under siege. Present day Ranwar reflects changed times. The once quiet, peaceful lanes are now bustling thoroughfares for traffic seeking a short route from the Bandra Reclamation to 'Hill Road' and beyond. The ever-present dust and noise and a dozen traffic jams a day are now accepted with stoic resignation. 

Where are the doorstops ?

The most telling and poignant reminder of an era gone forever, is the sight today of village doors, closed in the daytime. Was a time a few years ago, when the door to every home, was opened at daybreak or a little before and kept open the entire day through, with little, swivel wooden doorstops at the bottom to prevent the wind from slamming them shut. Both the front and the back entrances were left wide open, welcoming neighbours and friends who might happen to drop in. Theft was a rarity as was the presence of a stranger in the neighbourhood. Every passerby was a familiar face and most called out a greeting or stopped for a short chat and a bit of gossip. Time was to spend in renewing contacts constantly. 
Change is inevitable and to blindly resist change may be futile and foolish. Perhaps localities and lifestyles, now in their twilight, will give way to different, eventually equally rich and valuable experiences. If that is so, then the present, impersonal and sometimes adversary relationships nurtured by today's housing societies and high rises can be viewed as a transient feature, en route. 
And meanwhile, one can even today, travel to places like Gorai and Uttan to the north, or south to Korlai and Rev Danda and catch a glimpse of yesterday's Ranwar, or Pali or Sherly. Of quiet, shady lanes between quiet, peaceful, red tiled houses and, if one is patient, the sight of a mother hen and several cheeping chicks trickling across the street in search of a scratched meal, or a lone, grunting pig, rooting around - tomorrow's pork vindaal on hooves. But for how long will these quaint places endure? Development, that dread tide in our affairs and lives, cannot be far off and with it more cause for wistful nostalgia.

Evidence of a Heritage 
under Siege

Xavier House, one of the older buildings in the heart of Ranwar, photographed here as it stood up until around 1999. The present structure was built in 1841. (The carved wooden plaque above, was embedded in the wall over the main entrance of the house. The IHS symbollises 'Christ' and below it, the three nails used to crucify Christ, pierce His heart symbolically). 
This rambling, spacious bungalow was typical of the buildings in villages like Ranwar. It had a quaint veranda, with two plain teak benches and wrought iron railings, where passers by used to drop in to chat during the day or evening. The rooms were large and airy and the high wooden ceiling, held a loft that extended through the building. There was a wide garden to the east and a sprawling compound behind the bungalow with two large outhouses, a huge, gnarled tamarind tree, over a hundred years old, an equally tall jambool tree and several coconut palms. 
The property was sold to a developer and the original building was demolished at the start of the new millennium.
A photograph shows the partly demolished building with the rooms exposed. The walls were constructed using bricks and white limestone ladhis that were typical of the area. The loft floor and the roof were constructed using solid teak beams that withstood the ravages of time and termites but finally gave way to development in the form of a multistoryed concrete and steel behemoth.
Despite its inappropriate location in a gaothan and heritage area the multi-unit apartment stands as stark evidence of the pressures which villages like Ranwar, Pali, Sherly and Rajan are subject to. The sewer lines, laid in the 1920s were never intended for the huge number of housing units that now have sprung up, with the result that the drains perennially clog and back up. The narrow lanes cannot handle the vastly increased through-traffic and the parking spaces required to accommodate resident vehicles, so that the quiet street, reflecting widespread changes in Bandra, is a chaotic, noisy thoroughfare with traffic jams occurring at bottlenecks, several times each day.

For Better and Worse or,
 Going Going ...
The passing away of the dhobi, not quite yet, tailor, pretty much happening, the mochi, there is the odd holdout now. Not to mention the kalai walla, who came around to recoat one's vessels, the suri-dar walla with his huge freewheel that manually drove his grinding wheel to sharpen kitchen knives and such. Still holding out are the masala wallees who with their uknees and _ pound our EI masala every summer. That unforgettable thud thud in impeccable orderly sequence. The cotton fluffer, what on earth are they called, with his ungainly stringed instrument that he twanged as he walked his beat. Shanti who made her rounds each afternoon selling puranpolis in her little bamboo basket, warm and cushioned in layers of clean white linen in her small woven bamboo basket. The same Shanti who for generations was also the lady of choice for the mandatory oil bath given to infants in the first few months after they were born. And the huge samosa walla, he must have been Afghani with his fur cap and fierce mustache, who despite his buld disdained to carry the equally big basket that contained his wares, but instead had a little scrawny helper who did it for him. Once upon a while there were hand made 'gauti' tiles covered our house roofs, that gave way to more uniform clay Mangalore tiles. And now those too are disappearing along with the Kathiawari Vikrambhai or Rajeshbhai who came around each April to set up dambar and cloth works in the back yard and repair the roof tiles.
Aunty Agnes, the 'fast bowler'; bakriwalla, the old piano tuner, who kept a needle stashed away in his palm to use against the many children who for some reason, cruelly taunted him as he passed through Ranwar and other places.
