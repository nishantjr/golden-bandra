The Varsity Circle
==================

---

What could not be done by the whole host of our
readers has been achieved by on man -- a single member of the Varsity
Circle. We are not boasting and we are not bragging, we're merely
stating the facts, and if the facts should flatter us to the discredit of
others, it will not be through the fault of ours.

There certainly was no necessity for our making
this number a one-man concern but we thought we'd do it for lark.
This was our way of meeting the situation. We are living in an age of
stunts and at the moment we cannot conceive a more unique one than to
get one man to shoulder the whole hob and be responsible for everything
from cover to cover in what should have been the Readers' Number.

Our idea in getting up a Readers Number was to
give constributors a much needed holiday. That object, in spite of our
readers' stubborn non-cooperation, has now been achieved. True, one man
has to work over-time for this, but that one man would be condemned to
hard labour in any event. As for the promised Readers' articles, they
may now be folded and shelved, we no longer require them -- not for a
Readers' Number at least. We are through with the idea.

All things change and perhaps the contributor who
so cleverly put forward the plea that the Varsity Circle should more

---

appropriately be called the Varsity Triangle will have good reason to
revise his opinion now. With the Editor on an indefinite leave and
the Rambler on an unprovoked strike, what was once a Circle and later
changed into a triangle has now dwindled to a mere point. Of course
the geometrical definition of a point -- that is has position but no
magnitude is hardly calculated to flatter a well-meaning solo acting --
editor, but this does not bother us. We rather congratulate ourselves on
having discovered this jab on ourselves. But what we're dealing with is
more than mere geometry, and a glance at our cover picture will reveal
to our unbelieving readers the Herculean task we are up against.

It comes in the experience of almost every
mortal to get stuck sometimes and we're no exception. At the
present moment we have stumbled over the variety entertainment held
recently in Bandra for the very creditable purpose of giving relief
to the unemployed. Apparently after treating the cast and defraying such
minor expenses as the hire of the hall and a Royalty of Rupees 200 for
the play there still remained a tidy balance with which to carry out the
object of the entertainment.

The relief it appears took the shape of a grand
banquet to which the unemployed of the neighbourhood were invited, the
idea being presumably that 'one crowded hour of gorgeous fare is
worth an age without a meal.' We give it up.


The 'Adventures of Dan' -- the last article in this
Number is not exactly a new feature in this Magazine, but it is with-
out doubt something out of the usual run of articles recieved. We reserve
our comments and invite criticism.
