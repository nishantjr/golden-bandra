title: Other Crosses of the Church of St Andrew

A carved stone cross of unknown origin, sculpted in 1720, stands on a
pedestal at the northern extremity of the graveyard, opposite the start

of St Paul Road, where there was a side-gate in the compound wall. This
gate was removed in 1983, and the space has been walled up.

Some parishioners will remember that this cross originally stood in
front of our church where today the statue of Christ the King stands.

It is said that when the cross was removed in 1934, to make place for
the statue, it was left discarded lying in the church compound. The then
Vicar,

Msgr Dominic DeSa who was responsible for its removal, became rather
ill; this was the signal reminder for him to have the cross set up on a
pedestal where it stands today; he did this and his illness left him.

St Andrew. It is now located alongside the south compound wall between
the stone cross of Santa Anna and the Oratory.](./CrossAnd.jpg)

Yet another stone cross stands on a pedestal in the temporary graveyard
opposite the Virendra housing colony in the south side of the church
compound.

This cross was sculpted to commemorate the completion of the third
chapel on the Mount in 1761. The cross was originally planted on a
pedestal beside the road in front of Mount Mary Chapel. Years later this
cross was removed and brought to St Andrew\'s to be set up in its
present position.

The date 1761 is carved at the base of the cross.
